<p>So I would like something like:</p>

<pre><code>dat$vec1$vec2[$#]

The inner function acquires and stores a large vector of data in memory (as a global variable... I'm using ""R"" which is like ""S-Plus""). The loop loops through a long list of data to be acquired. The outer function starts the process and passes in the list of datasets to be acquired.</p>

<pre><code>for (dataset in list_of_datasets) {
  for (datachunk in dataset) {
    &lt;process datachunk&gt;

<p>I programmed the inner function to store each dataset before moving to the next, so all the work of the outer function occurs as side effects on global variables... a big no-no. Is this better or worse than collecting and returning a giant, memory-hogging vector of vectors? Is there a superior third approach?</p>

<p>Would the answer change if I were storing the data vectors in a database rather than in memory? Ideally, I'd like to be able to terminate the function (or have it fail due to network timeouts) without losing all the information processed prior to termination.</p>

<p>I have an intuitive notion of how quantiles work, and an M.S. in stats, but boy oh boy, the documentation for it is confusing to me.  </p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q[i](p) = (1 - gamma) x[j] + gamma
  x[j+1],</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm with it so far.  For a type <em>i</em> quantile, it's an interpolation between x[j] and x [j+1], based on some mysterious constant <em>gamma</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= 9, (j-m)/n &lt;= p &lt;
  (j-m+1)/ n, x[j] is the jth order
  statistic, n is the sample size, and m
  is a constant determined by the sample
  quantile type. Here gamma depends on
  the fractional part of g = np+m-j. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how calculate j?   m?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the continuous sample quantile
  types (4 through 9), the sample
  quantiles can be obtained by linear
  interpolation between the kth order
  statistic and p(k): </p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - alpha) / (n - alpha - beta
  + 1),
  where α and β are constants determined
  by the type. Further, m = alpha + p(1
  - alpha - beta), and gamma = g.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I'm really lost.  p, which was a constant before, is now apparently a function.  </p>

<p>So for Type 7 quantiles, the default...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type 7</p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1). In this case, p(k) = mode[F(x[k])]. This is used by S. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone want to help me out?  In particular I'm confused by the notation of p being a function and a constant, what the heck <em>m</em> is, and now to calculate j for some particular <em>p</em>.  </p>

<p>I hope that based on the answers here, we can submit some revised documentation that better explains what is going on here.  </p>
