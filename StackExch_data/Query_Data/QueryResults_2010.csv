<p><em>Edit:</em> It turns out that RinS doesn't work on Windows.  I found that the easiest solution was to just use Rscript.  I can call this from S-Plus with the <code>system()</code> command.  For example, here's a simple script:</p>

"2050790","1","2051159","","2010-01-12 17:08:50","","326","206356","<p>Brief background: Many (most?) contemporary programming languages in widespread use have at least a handful of ADTs [abstract data types] in common, in particular,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>string</strong> (a sequence comprised of characters)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>list</strong> (an ordered collection of values), and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>map-based type</strong> (an unordered array that maps keys to values)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the R programming language, the first two are implemented as <code>character</code> and <code>vector</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>When I began learning R, two things were obvious almost from the start: <code>list</code> is the most important data type in R (because it is the parent class for the R <code>data.frame</code>), and second, I just couldn't understand how they worked, at least not well enough to use them correctly in my code.</p>

<p>For one thing, it seemed to me that R's <code>list</code> data type was a straightforward implementation of the map ADT (<code>dictionary</code> in Python, <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> in Objective C, <code>hash</code> in Perl and Ruby, <code>object literal</code> in Javascript, and so forth).</p>

<p>For instance, you create them just like you would a Python dictionary, by passing key-value pairs to a constructor (which in Python is <code>dict</code> not <code>list</code>):</p>

<pre><code>x = list(""ev1""=10, ""ev2""=15, ""rv""=""Group 1"")
</code></pre>

<p>And you access the items of an R List just like you would those of a Python dictionary, e.g., <code>x['ev1']</code>. Likewise, you can retrieve just the <em>'keys'</em> or just the <em>'values'</em> by: </p>

<pre><code>names(x)    # fetch just the 'keys' of an R list
# [1] ""ev1"" ""ev2"" ""rv""

unlist(x)   # fetch just the 'values' of an R list
#   ev1       ev2        rv 
#  ""10""      ""15"" ""Group 1"" 

x = list(""a""=6, ""b""=9, ""c""=3)  

sum(unlist(x))
# [1] 18
</code></pre>

<p>but R <code>list</code>s are also <strong><em>unlike</em></strong> other map-type ADTs (from among the languages I've learned anyway). My guess is that this is a consequence of the initial spec for S, i.e., an intention to design a data/statistics DSL [domain-specific language] from the ground-up. </p>

<p><em>three</em> significant differences between R <code>list</code>s and mapping types in other languages in widespread use (e.g,. Python, Perl, JavaScript):</p>

<p><em>first</em>, <code>list</code>s in R are an <em>ordered</em> collection, just like vectors, even though the values are keyed (ie, the keys can be any hashable value not just sequential integers). Nearly always, the mapping data type in other languages is <em>unordered</em>.</p>

<p><em>second</em>, <code>list</code>s can be returned from functions even though you never passed in a <code>list</code> when you called the function, and <em>even though</em> the function that returned the <code>list</code> doesn't contain an (explicit) <code>list</code> constructor (Of course, you can deal with this in practice by wrapping the returned result in a call to <code>unlist</code>):</p>

<pre><code>x = strsplit(LETTERS[1:10], """")     # passing in an object of type 'character'

class(x)                            # returns 'list', not a vector of length 2
# [1] list
</code></pre>

<p>A <em>third</em> peculiar feature of R's <code>list</code>s: it doesn't seem that they can be members of another ADT, and if you try to do that then the primary container is coerced to a <code>list</code>. E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>x = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.23, list(0.5, 0.2, 0.9), recursive=TRUE)

class(x)
# [1] list
</code></pre>

<p>my intention here is not to criticize the language or how it is documented; likewise, I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong with the <code>list</code> data structure or how it behaves. All I'm after is to correct is my understanding of how they work so I can correctly use them in my code. </p>

<p>Here are the sorts of things I'd like to better understand:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the rules which determine when a function call will return a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>strsplit</code> expression recited above)?</p></li>
<li><p>If I don't explicitly assign names to a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>list(10,20,30,40)</code>) are the default names just sequential integers beginning with 1?  (I assume, but I am far from certain that the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be able to coerce this type of <code>list</code> to a vector w/ a call to <code>unlist</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Why do these two different operators, <code>[]</code>, and <code>[[]]</code>, return the <em>same</em> result?</p>

<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>

<p>both expressions return ""1"":</p>

<p><code>x[1]</code></p>

<p><code>x[[1]]</code></p></li>
<li><p>why do these two expressions <strong>not</strong> return the same result?</p>

<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>

<p><code>x2 = list(1:4)</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please don't point me to the R Documentation (<a href=""http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/list"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>?list</code></a>, <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-intro.html#Lists"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>R-intro</code></a>)--I have read it carefully and it does not help me answer the type of questions I recited just above.</p>

<p>(lastly, I recently learned of and began using an R Package (available on CRAN) called <a href=""http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/packages/info/?hash"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>hash</code></a> which implements <em>conventional</em> map-type behavior via an S4 class; I can certainly recommend this Package.)</p>

<p>How can I read that type of shape file correctly in R for plotting? (it looks like a normal shape in ArcMap)</p>

<p>(shows a shape file where some polygons are wrongly filled)</p>

<p>I used the following code in R:</p>

<pre><code>require(maptools)
require(rgdal)

So for the sake of my dog and my liver, what's concise syntax for doing a ddply operation on every row of a data frame?</p>

<p>Here's an example that works well for a simple case:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- rnorm(10)
y &lt;- rnorm(10)
df &lt;- data.frame(x,y)
ddply(df,names(df) ,function(df) max(df$x,df$y))
</code></pre>

<p>that works fine and gives me what I want. But if things get more complex this causes plyr to get funky (and not like Bootsy Collins) because plyr is chewing on making ""levels"" out of all those floating point values</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
y &lt;- rnorm(1000)
z &lt;- rnorm(1000)
myLetters &lt;- sample(letters, 1000, replace=T)
df &lt;- data.frame(x,y, z, myLetters)
ddply(df,names(df) ,function(df) max(df$x,df$y))
</code></pre>

<p>on my box this chews for a few minutes and then returns:</p>

<pre><code>Error: memory exhausted (limit reached?)
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In paste(rep(l, each = ll), rep(lvs, length(l)), sep = sep) :
  Reached total allocation of 1535Mb: see help(memory.size)
2: In paste(rep(l, each = ll), rep(lvs, length(l)), sep = sep) :
  Reached total allocation of 1535Mb: see help(memory.size)
</code></pre>

<p>I think I am totally abusing plyr and I am not saying this is a bug in plyr, but rather abusive behavior by me (liver and dog notwithstanding).</p>

<p>So in short, is there syntax shortcut for using ddply to operate on every row as a substitute for <code>apply(X, 1, ...)</code>?</p>

<p>The workaround I've been using is to create a ""key"" that gives a unique value for every row and then I can join back to it. </p>

<pre><code> x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
 y &lt;- rnorm(1000)
 z &lt;- rnorm(1000)
 myLetters &lt;- sample(letters, 1000, replace=T)
 df &lt;- data.frame(x,y, z, myLetters)
  #make the key
 df$myKey &lt;- 1:nrow(df)
 myOut &lt;- merge(df, ddply(df,""myKey"" ,function(df) max(df$x,df$y)))
  #knock out the key
 myOut$myKey &lt;- NULL
</code></pre>

<p>But I keep thinking that ""There Has to Be a Better Way""</p>

I have been trying to get the AUC value for a classification problem and have been trying to use e1071 and ROCR packages in R for this. ROCR has a nice example ""ROCR.simple"" which has prediction values and label values.</p>

<pre><code>library(ROCR)
data(ROCR.simple)
pred&lt;-prediction(ROCR.simpe$predictions, ROCR.simple$labels)
auc&lt;-performance(pred,""auc"")
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the AUC value, no problem.
MY PROBLEM is: How do I get the type of data given by <code>ROCR.simple$predictions</code> in the above example?
I run my analysis like</p>

<pre><code>library(e1071)
data(iris)
y&lt;-Species
x&lt;-iris[,1:2]
model&lt;-svm(x,y)
pred&lt;-predict(model,x)
</code></pre>

<p>Upto here I'm ok. 
Then how do I get the kind of predictions that <code>ROCR.simpe$predictions</code> give?</p>

<p>Q2:</p>

<p>there is a nice example involving <code>ROCR.xvals</code>. This is a problem with 10 cross validations.</p>

<p>They run</p>

<pre><code>pred&lt;-prediction(ROCR.xval$predictions,ROCR.xval$labels)
auc&lt;-performance(pred,""auc"")
</code></pre>

<p>This gives results for all 10 cross validations.</p>

<p>My problem is:</p>

<p>How do I use </p>

<pre><code>model&lt;-svm(x,y,cross=10)     # where x and y are as given in Q1
</code></pre>

<p>and get all 10 results of predictions and labels into a list as given in <code>ROCR.xvals</code>?</p>

"2139703","1","","","2010-01-26 13:44:01","","2","1402","<p>One of the most important issues in using factor analysis is its interpretation. Factor analysis often uses factor rotation to enhance its interpretation. After a satisfactory rotation, the rotated factor loading matrix <strong>L'</strong> will have the same ability to represent the correlation matrix and it can be used as the factor loading matrix, instead of the unrotated matrix <strong>L</strong>.</p>

<p>The purpose of rotation is to make the rotated factor loading matrix have some desirable properties. One of the methods used is to rotate the factor loading matrix such that the rotated matrix will have a <strong>simple structure</strong>.</p>

<p>L. L. Thurstone introduced the Principle of Simple Structure, as a general guide for factor rotation:</p>

<h2>Simple Structure Criteria:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Each row of the factor matrix should contain at least one zero</li>
<li>If there are m common factors, each column of the factor matrix should have at least m zeros</li>
<li>For every pair of columns in the factor matrix, there should be several variables for which entries approach zero in the one column but not in the other</li>
<li>For every pair of columns in the factor matrix, a large proportion of the variables should have entries approaching zero in both columns when there are four or more factors</li>
<li>For every pair of columns in the factor matrix, there should be only a small number of variables with nonzero entries in both columns</li>
</ol>

<p>The ideal simple structure is such that:</p>

<ol>
<li>each item has a high, or meaningful, loading on one factor only and</li>
<li>each factor have high, or meaningful, loadings for only some of the items.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that, trying several combinations of rotation methods along with the parameters that each one accepts (especially for oblique ones), the number of candidate matrices increases and it is very difficult to see which one better meets the above criteria.</p>

<p>When I first faced that problem I realized that I was unable to select the best match by merely 'looking' at them, and that I needed an algorithm to help me decide. Under the stress of project's deadlines, the most I could do was to write the following code in MATLAB, which accepts one rotation matrix at a time and returns (under some assumptions) whether each criterion is met or not.
A new version (If I would ever tried to upgrade it) would accept a 3d matrix (a set of 2d matrices) as an argument, and the algorithm should return the one that better fits the above criteria.</p>

<p>I am just asking for your opinions (I also think that there's been criticism over the usefulness of the method by itself) and perhaps better approaches to the rotation matrix selection problem. If someone wants to provide some code, I would prefer R or MATLAB. </p>

<p>P.S. The above <a href=""http://books.google.gr/books?id=5Jyaa2LQWbQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=%22The+criteria+of+simple+structure+was+originally+proposed%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OXsCeU0Nzi&amp;sig=qfiLMUyXsgwPunWBgNdSEeBNm34&amp;hl=el&amp;ei=huZeS5nkApTE4gaC67HsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20criteria%20of%20simple%20structure%20was%20originally%20proposed%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Simple Structure Criteria formulation</a> can be found in the book <em>""Making Sense of Factor Analysis""</em> by PETT, M., LACKEY, N., SULLIVAN, J.</p>

<p>P.S.2 (from the same book): <em>""A test of successful factor analysis is the extent to which it can reproduce the original corr matrix. If you also used oblique solutions, among all select the one that generated the greatest number of highest and lowest factor loadings.""</em> 
This sounds like another constraint that the algorithm could use.</p>

<pre><code>require(SuppDists)

<p>So far the loop approach works fine. However, it looks pretty inefficient and I am wondering if there is a faster and easier approach.</p>

<p>Here is the scenario:
I have a directory with several <code>.csv</code> files. Each file contains the same identifier which can be used as the merger variable. Since the files are rather large in size I thought to read each file one at a time into R instead of reading all files at once.
So I get all the files of the directory with <code>list.files</code> and read in the first two files. Afterwards I use <code>merge</code> to get one <code>data.frame</code>.</p>

<pre><code>FileNames &lt;- list.files(path="".../tempDataFolder/"")
FirstFile &lt;- read.csv(file=paste("".../tempDataFolder/"", FileNames[1], sep=""""),

dataMerge &lt;- merge(FirstFile, SecondFile, by=c(""COUNTRYNAME"", ""COUNTRYCODE"", ""Year""),
             all=T)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I use a <code>for</code> loop to get all the remaining <code>.csv</code> files and <code>merge</code> them into the already existing <code>data.frame</code>:</p>

dataMerge &lt;- merge(dataMerge, ReadInMerge, by=c(""COUNTRYNAME"", ""COUNTRYCODE"", ""Year""),

<p>I have two datasets with information that I need to merge. The only common fields that I have are strings that do not perfectly match and a numerical field that can be substantially different </p>

<p>The only way to explain the problem is to show you the data. Here is <a href=""http://bertelsen.ca/R/a.csv"" rel=""noreferrer"">a.csv</a> and <a href=""http://bertelsen.ca/R/b.csv"" rel=""noreferrer"">b.csv</a>. I am trying to merge B to A.</p>

<p>There are three fields in B and four in A. Company Name (File A Only), Fund Name, Asset Class, and Assets. So far, my focus has been on attempting to match the Fund Names by replacing words or parts of the strings to create exact matches and then using: </p>

<pre><code>a &lt;- read.table(file = ""http://bertelsen.ca/R/a.csv"",header=TRUE, sep="","", na.strings=F, strip.white=T, blank.lines.skip=F, stringsAsFactors=T) 
b &lt;- read.table(file = ""http://bertelsen.ca/R/b.csv"",header=TRUE, sep="","", na.strings=F, strip.white=T, blank.lines.skip=F, stringsAsFactors=T)
merge(a,b, by=""Fund.Name"") 
</code></pre>

<p>However, this only brings me to about 30% matching. The rest I have to do by hand. </p>

<p>Assets is a numerical field that is not always correct in either and can vary wildly if the fund has low assets. Asset Class is a string field that is ""generally"" the same in both files, however, there are discrepancies. </p>

<p>Adding to the complication are the different series of funds, in File B. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AGF Canadian Value </p>
  
  <p>AGF Canadian Value-D</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these cases, I have to choose the one that is not seried, or choose the one that is called ""A"", ""-A"", or ""Advisor"" as the match. </p>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>What would you say is the best approach? This excercise is something that I have to do on a monthly basis and matching them manually is incredibly time consuming. Examples of code would be instrumental. </p>

<p><strong>IDEAS</strong></p>

<p>One method that I think may work is normalizing the strings based on the first capitalized letter of each word in the string. But I haven't been able to figure out how to pull that off using R.</p>

<p>Another method I considered was creating an index of matches based on a combination of assets, fund name, asset class and company. But again, I'm not sure how to do this with R. Or, for that matter, if it's even possible.</p>

<p>Examples of code, comments, thoughts and direction are greatly appreciated!   </p>

One is called <code>descriptions</code> and where each element is (maybe) a tokenized string. The other is called <code>probes</code> where each element is a number. I need to make a dictionary that maps<code>probes</code> to something in <code>descriptions</code>, if that something is there. Here's how I'm going about this:</p>

<pre><code>probe2gene &lt;- list()
for (i in 1:length(probes)){
 strings&lt;-strsplit(descriptions[i]), '//')
 if (length(strings[[1]]) &gt; 1){ 
  probe2gene[probes[i]] = strings[[1]][2]
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which works fine, but seems slow, much slower than the roughly equivalent python:</p>

<pre><code>probe2gene = {}
for p,d in zip(probes, descriptions):
    try:
     probe2gene[p] = descriptions.split('//')[1]
    except IndexError:
     pass

<p>My question: is there an ""R-thonic"" way of doing what I'm trying to do? The <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Repetitive-execution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">R manual entry on for loops</a> suggests that such loops are rare. Is there a better solution?</p>

<p>Edit: a typical good ""description"" looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>""NM_009826 // Rb1cc1 // RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 // 1 A2 // 12421 /// AB070619 // Rb1cc1 // RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 // 1 A2 // 12421 /// ENSMUST00000027040 // Rb1cc1 // RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 // 1 A2 // 12421""
</code></pre>

<p>a bad ""description: looks like this</p>

<pre><code>""-----""
</code></pre>

<p>though it can quite easily be some other not-very-helpful string. Each probe is simply a number. The <code>probe</code> and <code>description</code> vectors are the same length, and completely correspond to each other, i.e. <code>probe[i]</code> maps to <code>description[i]</code>.</p>

This seemed like a really good way to handle things since I am working with Hadoop and all output needs to stream through stdin and stdout. </p>

<p>The problem I am left with is how to read these objects out of the text file and back into R on my desktop machine. Here's a working example that illustrates the challenge:</p>

<p>Let's create a tmp file and write a single object into it. This object is just a vector:</p>

<pre><code>outCon &lt;- file(""c:/tmp"", ""w"")
mychars &lt;- rawToChar(serialize(1:10, NULL, ascii=T))
cat(mychars, file=outCon)
close(outCon)

<p>The mychars object looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; mychars

13
10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</code></pre>

<p>I'm probably overlooking something terribly obvious, but how do I read this file back into R and unserialize the object? When I try scan() or readLines() both want to treat the new line characters as record delimiters and I end up with a vector where each element is a row from the text file. What I really want is a text string with the whole contents of the file. Then I can unserialize the string. </p>

<p>Perl will read line breaks back into a string, but I can't figure out how to override the way R treats line breaks. </p>

<p>Two (very) interesting discussions talk about how to deal with the workflow. But neither of them refer to the revision control element:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1266279/how-to-organize-large-r-programs"">How to organize large R programs?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1429907/workflow-for-statistical-analysis-and-report-writing"">Workflow for statistical analysis and report writing</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Long Update To The Question</strong>: Following some of the people's answers, and Dirk's question in the comment, I would like to direct my question a bit more.</p>

<p>After reading the Wiki article about ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">revision control</a>"" (which I was previously not familiar with), it was clear to me that when using revision control, what one does is to build a <strong>development structure</strong> of his code. This structure either leads to a ""final product"" or to several branches.</p>

<p>When building something like, let's say, a website. There is usually one end product you work towards (the website), with some prototypes along the way.</p>

<p>But when doing a statistical analysis, the work (to my view) is different. Sometimes you know where you want to get to. But more often, you explore. Explore cleaning the dataset. Explore different methods for statistical analysis, and ask various questions of your data (and I am writing this, knowing how Frank Harrell, and other experience statisticians feels about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Data dredging</a>).</p>

<p>That is why the workflow question with statistical programming is (in my view) a serious and deep question, raising many issues, The simpler ones are technical:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which revision control software do you use (and why) ?</li>
<li>Which IDE do you use(and why) ? 
The more interesting question are about work process:</li>
<li>How do you structure your files?</li>
<li>What do you keep as a separate file and what as a revision? or asking in a different way - What should be a ""branch"" and what should be a ""sub project"" in your code? For example: When starting to explore your data, should a plot be creating and then erased because it didn't lead any where (but kept as a revision) or should there be a backup file of that path?</li>
</ul>

<p>How <strong>you</strong> solve this tension was my initial curiosity. The second question is ""what might I be missing?"". What rules (of thumb) should one follow so to avoid common pitfalls doing statistical programming with version control?</p>

<p>In my <strong>intuition</strong>, I feel that statistical programming is inherently different then software development (I am writing this without being a real expert in statistical programming, and even less so in software development). That's way I am unsure which of the lessons I have read here about version control would be applicable.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,

<pre><code>#Read csv file with two rows of headers
#Append the second row to the first row
df &lt;-read.csv(csvfile,skip=1,stringsAsFactors=FALSE) #Read csv without any header

<p>Analyzing the data can involve many twists and turns of statistical procedures, and angles from which you look at your data. At the end, you have many files, with many lines of code, performing tasks on your data. Some of which is reusable and you capsulate it as a ""good to have"" function.</p>

<p>This process of ""Statistical analysis"" feels to me like ""programming"" But I am not sure it feels the same to everyone.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on Software development</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term software development is often
  used to refer to the activity of
  computer programming, which is the
  process of writing and maintaining the
  source code, whereas the broader sense
  of the term includes all that is
  involved between the conception of the
  desired software through to the final
  manifestation of the software.
  Therefore, software development may
  include research, new development,
  modification, reuse, re-engineering,
  maintenance, or any other activities
  that result in software products.
  For larger software systems, usually
  developed by a team of people, some
  form of process is typically followed
  to guide the stages of production of
  the software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this simplistic definition (and my humble opinion), this sounds very much like building a statistical analysis. But I imagine it is not that simple.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my question: <strong>what differences can you outline between the two activities?</strong></p>

<p>It can be in terms of the technical aspects, the different strategies or work styles, and what ever else you think is relevant.</p>

    I'm taking my first course in multiple linear regression, so I'm still a beginner in R. We've recently learned a bit about taking slices of bivariate scatterplot data, both horizontally and vertically. What I'd like to know is how to go beyond a basic scatterplot, and take advantage of conditionally grouping data by slices to examine patterns.
    </p>

<p><p>
  As an example, I'm working with high-octane data from a bank where we're regressing employee's current salary <code>csalary</code> onto their beginning salary <code>bsalary</code>. Here's what my dataframe looks like.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    > str(data)
    'data.frame':   474 obs. of  10 variables:
     $ id     : num  628 630 632 633 635 637 641 649 650 652 ...
     $ bsalary: num  8400 24000 10200 8700 17400 ...
     $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels ""Male"",""Female"": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
     $ time   : num  81 73 83 93 83 80 79 67 96 77 ...
     $ age    : num  28.5 40.3 31.1 31.2 41.9 ...
     $ csalary: num  16080 41400 21960 19200 28350 ...
     $ educlvl: num  16 16 15 16 19 18 15 15 15 12 ...
     $ work   : num  0.25 12.5 4.08 1.83 13 ...
     $ jobcat : Factor w/ 7 levels ""Clerical"",""Office Trainee"",..: 4 5 5 4 5 4 1 1 1 3 ...
     $ ethnic : Factor w/ 2 levels ""White"",""Non-White"": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  To explore the relationship of <code>bsalary</code> and <code>csalary</code> I created a scatterplot using some of the functionality of <code>lattice</code> library. I arbitrarily drew vertical lines at $5000 intervals along <code>bsalary</code>.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
  <code>
    library (lattice)
    # Constructing vertical ""slices"" of our csalary ~ bsalary data
    # First we define a vector with our slice points, in this case 
    # $5,000 bsalary increments
    bslices = seq (from = 5000, to = 30000, by = 5000)
    length (bslices)
    xyplot (csalary ~ bsalary,
        main  = ""Current Bank Employee Salary as Predicted by Beginning Salary"",
        xlab  = ""Beginning Salary ($USD)"",
        ylab  = ""Current Salary ($USD)"",
        panel = function(...){
            panel.abline(v = bslices, col=""red"", lwd=2);
            panel.xyplot(...);
        }
    )
  </code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  The above code gets me this.

<p>
  Which is fantastic. But I feel like there ought to be a simple way to generate, from my data, graphs that group slice data into boxplots:
</p>

<p><a href=""https://evernote.com/products/skitch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iLDM3.jpg"" alt=""01LinReg.pdf (page 3 of 25)"" /></a><br/><sub>(source: <a href=""http://img.skitch.com/20100222-rhjudjw4txnfu43pycuqneuqan.preview.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skitch.com</a>)</sub><br/><br /></p>

<p><p>
   Or stacked-dot scatterplots, again grouped by slice, like this:
 </p></p>

<p><a href=""https://evernote.com/products/skitch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8bz0S.jpg"" alt=""01LinReg.pdf (page 3 of 25)"" /></a><br/><sub>(source: <a href=""http://img.skitch.com/20100222-cgsqwnhnd26k5qhb6gb2sjk1bs.preview.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skitch.com</a>)</sub><br/><br /></p>

<p><p>
  Ultimately, my question is how to turn raw scatterplot data into conditionally-grouped data. I feel like there are some simple, underlying features of lattice (or even the simpler plot commands that don't require it) that would allow me to start slicing my data to explore for patterns.
 </p></p>

Think of it as a simple map-reduce operation.  Processing a single chunk uses about 1GB of memory.  I'm running the program on a quad core PC, with 4GB of ram, running Windows XP.  I happen to have coded it up using R, but I don't think it's relevant.</p>

<p>My current hypothesis is that the processes are bounded by the memory performance, but I don't know the best way to investigate this further.  Any suggestions or guesses?</p>

<p>Edit: The program is not IO-bound in terms of the disk.  The processing step reads a chunk of a CSV file into memory, churns on it for 5 minutes or so, and then writes the result back out to a file on disk.  The file input and output takes a few seconds at most.</p>

We have about 150 subjects, and for each subject we performed a pair of tests (under different conditions) 18 times.
The 18 different conditions of the test are complementary, in such a way so that if we where to average over the tests (for each subject), we would get no correlation between the tests (between subjects).
What we wish to know is the correlation (and P value) between the tests, in within subjects, but over all the subjects.</p>

<p>The way I did this by now was to perform the correlation for each subject, and then look at the distribution of the correlations received so to see if it's mean is different then 0.
But I suspect there might be a better way for answering the same question (someone said to me something about ""geographical correlation"", but a shallow search didn't help).</p>

I must admit that it's quite straightforward. There's a similar <code>recode</code> function in <code>car</code> package, and it does the trick, but let's presuppose that I want to get things done with <code>factor</code>.</p>

<p>I have <code>data.frame</code> with several variables with value range from 1 to 7. I want to ""reverse"" variable values, hence replacing 1s with 7s, 2s with 6s, 3s with 5s etc. I can utilize <code>factor</code> function:</p>

<pre><code># create dummy factor
set.seed(100)
x &lt;- as.factor(round(runif(100,1,7)))
y &lt;- factor(x, levels = rev(levels(x)))

&gt; levels(y)
[1] ""7"" ""6"" ""5"" ""4"" ""3"" ""2"" ""1""

<p>Problem starts when I want to recode factors that do not have equal levels. If some factor, z, has levels <code>c(""1"", ""3"", ""4"", ""6"", ""7"")</code>, is there any chance that I can ""reverse"" levels so 1=7, 2=6, 3=5 etc. by utilizing <code>factor</code> function?</p>

<p>Here is a toy example of the data structure:</p>

<pre><code>pop = data.frame(status = rbinom(n, 1, .42), sex = rbinom(n, 1, .5),
age = round(rnorm(n, mean=40, 10)), disType = rbinom(n, 1, .2),

31
11
31
31
11
11
11
31
11
</code></pre>

<p>2) I need to identify the least frequent SNP value (in the above example it is 31).</p>

<p>3) I need to replace the least frequent SNP value with 1 and the other(s) with 0.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://rosuda.org/JRI/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JRI</a> website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JRI is a Java/R Interface, which allows to run R inside Java
  applications as a single thread.
  Basically it loads R dynamic library
  into Java and provides a Java API to R
  functionality. It supports both simple
  calls to R functions and a full
  running REPL.</p>
  
  <p>In a sense JRI is the inverse of rJava
  and both can be combined (i.e. you can
  run R code inside JRI that calls back
  to the JVM via rJava). The JGR project
  makes the full use of both JRI and
  rJava to provide a full Java GUI for
  R.</p>
  
  <p>JRI uses native code, but it supports
  all platforms where Sun's Java (or
  compatible) is available, including
  Windows, Mac OS X, Sun and Linux (both
  32-bit and 64-bit).</p>

<p>And now a short demonstration... actually, I'm about to explain what I primarily intended to do. I wanted to subset a <code>data.frame</code> by vectors gathered in <code>list</code> object. Since this is a part of code from a function that accompanies data manipulation in psychological research, you can consider <code>m</code> as a results from personality questionnaire (10 subjects, 20 vars). Vectors in list hold column indexes that define questionnaire subscales (e.g. personality traits). Each subscale is defined by several items (columns in <code>data.frame</code>). If we presuppose that the score on each subscale is nothing more than <code>sum</code> (or some other function) of row values (results on that part of questionnaire for each subject), you could run:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; dfsub(m, lst, sum)
    a  b  c
1  46 20 24
2  41 24 21

8  31 18 23
9  38 14 15
10 41 14 22

<p>I took a glance at this function and I must admit that this little loop isn't spoiling the code at all... BUT, if there's an easier/efficient way of doing this, please, let me know!</p>

<pre><code>&gt; x &lt;- rnbinom(100, mu = 10, size = 10)
&gt; hdev &lt;- function(par) {

      12       27
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose I generate random variables <code>x, y</code> and <code>z</code> where <code>z</code> acts as an index (from 1 to 3).</p>

<pre><code>&gt; x &lt;- rnbinom(100, mu = 10, size = 10)
&gt; y &lt;- rnbinom(100, mu = 10, size = 10)
&gt; z &lt;- rep(1:3, length=100)
&gt; A &lt;- cbind(x,y,z)
&gt; hdev &lt;- function(par) {
+     -sum(dnbinom(x+y, mu = par[1], size = par[2], log = TRUE))}
</code></pre>

<p>1) How can I apply <code>nlminb(c(9, 12), hdev)</code> to the data set by index <code>z</code>? In other words, I would like to compute <code>nlminb(c(9, 12), hdev)</code> for <code>z=1, z=2</code>, and <code>z=3</code> separately. I tried <code>by(A, z, function(A) nlminb(c(9,12), hdev))</code> and <code>sparseby(A, z, function(A) nlminb(c(9,12), hdev))</code>, but they return exactly the same values for each value of <code>z</code>.</p>

<p>2) I would like to turn each output into a new data frame so that it will become a 3X2 matrix.</p>

<pre><code>[1] Z1_ANSWER_1 Z1_ANSWER_2
[2] Z2_ANSWER_1 Z2_ANSWER_2
[3] Z3_ANSWER_1 Z3_ANSWER_2
</code></pre>

<p>Since nlminb returns the summary of statistics, I needed to use <code>CASEZ1&lt;-nlminb$par, CASEZ2&lt;-nlminb$par, CASEZ3&lt;-nlminb$par</code> and then use cbind to combine them. However, I would like to automate this process as the real data I'm working on has a lot more categories than <code>z</code> presented here.</p>

<p>If I'm not making myself clear, please let me know. I'll see if I can replicate the actual data set and functions I'm working on (I just don't have them on this computer).</p>

I wonder what are the relevant concepts (threads, concurrency, immutable data structures, recursion) and tools (Hadoop/MapReduce, Terracota, and Eucalyptus) to make this happen, and how specifically these concepts and tools are related to each other. I have a rudimentary background in R, Python, and bash scripting and also C and Fortran programming, though I'm familiar with some basic functional programming concepts also. Do I need to change the way that I program, use a different language (Clojure, Haskell, etc.), or simply (or not so simply!) adapt something like R/Hadoop (HRIPE)... or write wrappers for Python to enable multi-threading or Hadoop access? I understand this would might involve requirements for additional hardware and I would like some basic idea of what the requirements/options available might be.

<p>What is the optimal sharing of the job? Should I setup a Snow cluster using CPUs from both machines and split the job that way (i.e. use doSNOW for the foreach loop). Or should I use the two servers separately and use multicore on each server (i.e. split the job in two chunks, run them on each server and then stich it back together). </p>

<p>Basically what is an easy way to:
 1. Keep communication between servers down (since this is probably the slowest bit).
 2. Ensure that the random numbers generated in the servers are not highly correlated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>

<p>Using a time series package such as <code>xts</code> should be the solution; however I had no success using them and winded up using <code>cut</code>.  As I presently only need to plot histograms, with rows grouped by interval, this was enough.</p>

<p><code>cut</code> is used liked so:</p>

<pre><code>interv &lt;- function(x, start, period, num.intervals) {
  return(cut(x, as.POSIXlt(start)+0:num.intervals*period))
}

"2441562","1","2441650","","2010-03-14 08:06:26","","4","2785","<p>I am going through one of my .R files and by cleaning it up a little bit I am trying to get more familiar with writing the code the r-ight way. As a beginner, one of my favorite starting points is to get rid of the <code>for()</code> loops and try to transform the expression into a functional programming form.
So here is the scenario:</p>

<p>I am assembling a bunch of <code>data.frames</code> into a <code>list</code> for later usage. </p>

<pre><code>dataList &lt;- list (dataA,
                  dataB,
                  dataC,
                  dataD,
                  dataE
                  )
</code></pre>

<p>Now I like to take a look at each data.frame's column names and substitute certain character strings. Eg I like to substitute each ""foo"" and ""bar"" with ""baz"". At the moment I am getting the job done with a <code>for()</code> loop which looks a bit awkward.</p>

<pre><code>colnames(dataList[[1]])
[1] ""foo""        ""code"" ""lp15""       ""bar""       ""lh15""  
colnames(dataList[[2]])
[1] ""a""        ""code"" ""lp50""       ""ls50""       ""foo""  

matchVec &lt;- c(""foo"", ""bar"")
for (i in seq(dataList)) {
  for (j in seq(matchVec)) {
    colnames (dataList[[i]])[grep(pattern=matchVec[j], x=colnames (dataList[[i]]))] &lt;- c(""baz"")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since I am working here with a <code>list</code> I thought about the <code>lapply</code> function. My attempts handling the job with the <code>lapply</code> function all seem to look alright but only at first sight. If I write</p>

<pre><code>f &lt;- function(i, xList) {
  gsub(pattern=c(""foo""), replacement=c(""baz""), x=colnames(xList[[i]]))
}
lapply(seq(dataList), f, xList=dataList)
</code></pre>

<p>the last line prints out almost what I am looking for. However, if i take another look at the actual names of the data.frames in dataList:</p>

<pre><code>lapply (dataList, colnames)
</code></pre>

<p>I see that no changes have been made to the initial character strings.</p>

<p>So how can I rewrite the <code>for()</code> loop and transform it into a functional programming form?
And how do I substitute both strings, ""foo"" and ""bar"", in an efficient way? Since the <code>gsub()</code> function takes as its <code>pattern</code> argument only a character vector of length one.</p>

<p>Assume that we always have 4 stems (0 to 3), but that the length of letters before and after each of them can very.</p>

<p>The output should be something like the following list structure:</p>

<pre><code>list(
    ""Stem 0 opening"" = ""GCCTCGA"",
    ""before Stem 1"" = ""TA"",
    ""Stem 1"" = list(opening = ""GCTC"",
                inside = ""AGTTGGGA"",
                closing = ""GAGC""
            ),
    ""between Stem 1 and 2"" = ""G"",
    ""Stem 2"" = list(opening = ""TACGA"",
                inside = ""CTGAAGA"",
                closing = ""TCGTA""
            ),
    ""between Stem 2 and 3"" = ""AGGtC"",
    ""Stem 3"" = list(opening = ""ACCAG"",
                inside = ""TTCGATC"",
                closing = ""CTGGT""
            ),
    ""After Stem 3"" = """",
    ""Stem 0 closing"" = ""TCGGGGC""
)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have any experience with programming a parser, and would like advices as to what strategy to use when programming something like this (and any recommended R commands to use).</p>

<p>What I was thinking of is to first get rid of the ""Stem 0"", then go through the inner string with a recursive function (let's call it ""seperate.stem"") that each time will split the string into:
1. before stem
2. opening stem
3. inside stem
4. closing stem
5. after stem</p>

<p>Where the ""after stem"" will then be recursively entered into the same function (""seperate.stem"")</p>

<p>The thing is that I am not sure how to try and do this coding without using a loop.</p>

<p>Any advices will be most welcomed.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: someone sent me a bunch of question, here they are.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Does each sequence have the same number of "">>>>"" for the opening sequence as it does for ""&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;"" on the ending sequence?</strong><br>
A: Yes</p>

<p><strong>Q: Does the parsing always start with a partial stem 0 as your example shows?</strong> 
A: No. Sometimes it will start with a few "".""</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there a way of making sure you have the right sequences when you start?</strong> 
A: I am not sure I understand what you mean.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there a chance of error in the middle of the string that you have to restart from?</strong>
A: Sadly, yes. In which case, I'll need to ignore one of the inner stems...</p>

<p><strong>Q: How long are these strings that you want to parse?</strong> 
A: Each string has between 60 to 150 characters (and I have tens of thousands of them...)</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is each one a self contained sequence like you show in your example, or do they go on for thousands of characters?</strong> 
A: each sequence is self contained.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there always at least one '.' between stems?</strong><br>
A: No.</p>

<p><strong>Q: A full set of rules as to how the parsing should be done would be useful.</strong>
A: I agree.  But since I don't have even a basic idea on how to start coding this, I thought first to have some help on the beginning and try to tweak with the other cases that will come up before turning back for help.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you have the BNF syntax for parsing?</strong>
A: No. Your e-mail is the first time I came across it (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus</a>–Naur_Form).</p>

<p>However, this package only allows for one categoric variable (e.g. I can't study the prices clustered by color and by carat, as I can do with kruskal.test), and I don't know anything about the pgirmess package, whether it is maintained or not, or if it is tested.</p>

<p>Can you recommend me a package to execute the Kruskal-Wallis test which returns details for every comparison? How would you handle the problem?</p>

<p>Is there a package with some good cross tabbing/table examples that I could use to figure this out?   I'm sure I'm missing something simple, so I appreciate you pointing out what I missed.  Perhaps I have to generate each row as a separate list and then make a dataframe and print the dataframe?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've now discovered ctab() in package catspec, which is also on the right track.  It's interesting that R has no consistent equivalent to Ctables in SPSS, which is basically a ""tabbing"" tool ala the old tabulate tools used for survey research.   ctab() is trying, and is an admirable 1st step... but you still can't make this table (above) with it.</p>

<p>Here's the problem: I am drafting a survey report in Sweave with R and would like to report the marginal returns in line using <code>\Sexpr{}</code>. For example, rather than saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only 14% of respondents said 'X'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to write the report like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only \Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}$\%$ of respondents said 'X'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that Sweave converts the results of the expression in <code>\Sexpr{}</code> to a character string, which means that the output from the expression in R and the output that appears in my document are different. For example, above I use the function 'p.mean':</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>p.mean&lt;- function (x) {options(digits=1)  
mmm&lt;-weighted.mean(x, weight=weight, na.rm=T)  
print(100*mmm)  
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In R, the output looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>p.mean(variable)
&gt;14
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>but when I use <code>\Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}</code>, I get an unrounded character string (in this case: 13.5857142857143) in my document. I have tried to limit the output of my function to <code>digits=1</code> in the global environment, in the function itself, and and in various commands. It only seems to contain what R prints, not the character transformation that is the result of the expression and which eventually prints in the LaTeX file. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>as.character(p.mean(variable))  
&gt;[1] 14  
&gt;[1] ""13.5857142857143""  
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Does anyone know what I can do to limit the digits printed in the LaTeX file, either by reprogramming the R function or with a setting in Sweave or <code>\Sexpr{}</code>?</p>

            value4 = rep(""b"", 9))

dataList = list(d1, d2, d3, d4)
</code></pre>

<p>I looked at the answers to the question titled <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2209258/merge-several-data-frames-into-one-data-frame-with-a-loop"">""Merge several data.frames into one data.frame with a loop.""</a> I used the reduce method suggested there as well as a loop I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>try1 = mymerge(dataList)

try2 &lt;- Reduce(function(x, y) merge(x, y, all= TRUE,
by=c(""RID"", ""VISCODE"")), dataList, accumulate=F)

<p>where dataList is a list of data frames and mymerge is:</p>

  for(i in 2:L){

    mdat = merge(mdat, dataList[[i]], by.x = c(""RID"", ""VISCODE""),

  }

mdat
}
</code></pre>

<p>For my test data and subsets of my real data, both of these work fine and produce exactly the same results. However, when I use larger subsets of my data, they both break down and give me the following error: Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) : names do not match previous names.</p>

<p>The really weird thing is that using this works:</p>

<pre><code>  dataList = list(demog[1:50,],
            neurobat[1:50,],
            apoe[1:50,],
            mmse[1:50,],
            faq[1:47, ])

<p>And using this fails:</p>

<pre><code>  dataList = list(demog[1:50,],

            mmse[1:50,],
            faq[1:48, ])
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can tell, there is nothing special about row 48 of faq. Likewise, using this works:</p>

<pre><code>dataList = list(demog[1:50,],
            neurobat[1:50,],
            apoe[1:50,],
            mmse[1:50,],
            pdx[1:47, ])
</code></pre>

<p>And using this fails:</p>

<pre><code>dataList = list(demog[1:50,],
            neurobat[1:50,],
            apoe[1:50,],
            mmse[1:50,],
            pdx[1:48, ])
</code></pre>

<p>Row 48 in faq and row 48 in pdx have the same values for RID and VISCODE, the same value for EXAMDATE (something I'm not matching on) and different values for ID (another thing I'm not matching on). Besides the matching RID and VISCODE, I see anything special about them. They don't share any other variable names. This same scenario occurs elsewhere in the data without problems. </p>

<p>To add icing on the complication cake, this doesn't even work:</p>

<pre><code>dataList = list(demog[1:50,],
            neurobat[1:50,],
            apoe[1:50,],
            mmse[1:50,],
            faq[1:48, 2:3])
</code></pre>

<p>where columns 2 and 3 are ""RID"" and ""VISCODE"". </p>

<p>48 isn't even the magic number because this works:</p>

<pre><code> dataList = list(demog[1:500,],
            neurobat[1:500,],
            apoe[1:500,],

</code></pre>

<p>while using mmse[1:458, ] fails. </p>

<p>I can't seem to come up with test data that causes the problem. Has anyone had this problem before? Any better ideas on how to merge?</p>

<p>The y axis of the chart (example graph in the link) has an annotation: (million euro). Is there a way to create such types of annotations in ggplot2? Looking at the documentation there is no obvious way, since the ggplot does not explicitly let you put objects outside plotting area. But maybe there is some workaround?</p>

<p>One of the possible workarounds I thought about is using scales:</p>

<pre><code>data=data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10)
qplot(x=x,y=y,data=data)+scale_y_continuous(breaks=10.1,label=""Millions"")
</code></pre>

<p>But then how do I remove the tick? And it seems that since ggplot does not support multiple scales, I will need to grab the output of the scale_y_continuous, when it calculates the scales automaticaly and then add my custom break and label by hand. Maybe there is a better way?</p>

<p>In this situation, I have pre-defined windows at intervals of 100bp and I'm trying to calculate how much of each window is covered by the annotations in mylist.  Graphically, it looks something like this:</p>

<p>Naturally, this is being used on data sets that are much larger than the example I provide here.

<p>This ends up working for me, but depending on the size of the data and the number of groups I'm working with, this can take up to three days.</p>
<p>Besides branching out into parallel processing, is there any &quot;trick&quot; for making something like this run faster? For instance, converting the loops into something else (something like an apply with a function containing the stats I want to run inside the loop), or eliminating the need to actually assign the subset of data to a variable?</p>
<h3>Edit:</h3>
<p>Maybe this is just common knowledge (or sampling error), but I tried subsetting with brackets in some of my code rather than using the subset command, and it seemed to provide a slight performance gain which surprised me. I have some code I used and output below using the same object names as above:</p>
<pre><code>system.time(for(i in 1:1000){data.mat[data.mat$ID==groupids[i],]})  
</code></pre>

<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>In one of the answers, jorgusch suggested that I use the data.table package to speed up my subsetting. So, I applied it to a problem I ran earlier this week. In a dataset with a little over 1,500,000 rows, and 4 columns (ID,Var1,Var2,Var3), I wanted to calculate two correlations in each group (indexed by the &quot;ID&quot; variable). There are slightly more than 50,000 groups. Below is my initial code (which is very similar to the above):</p>
<pre><code>data.mat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;//home....&quot;)  
groupids &lt;- unique(data.mat$ID)
  
results &lt;- matrix(rep(&quot;NA&quot;,(length(groupids) * 3)),ncol=3,nrow=length(groupids))  

for(i in 1:length(groupids)) {  
  tempmat &lt;- data.mat[data.mat$ID==groupids[i],] 

  results[i,1] &lt;- groupids[i]  
  results[i,2] &lt;- cor(tempmat$Var1,tempmat$Var2,use=&quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;)  
  results[i,3] &lt;- cor(tempmat$Var1,tempmat$Var3,use=&quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;)    

}  
</code></pre>
<p>I'm re-running that right now for an exact measure of how long that took, but from what I remember, I started it running when I got into the office in the morning and it finished sometime in mid-afternoon. Figure 5-7 hours.</p>
<p>Restructuring my code to use data.table....</p>
<pre><code>data.mat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;//home....&quot;)  
data.mat &lt;- data.table(data.mat)  
  
testfunc &lt;- function(x,y,z) {  
  temp1 &lt;- cor(x,y,use=&quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;)  
  temp2 &lt;- cor(x,z,use=&quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;)  
  res &lt;- list(temp1,temp2)  
  res  
}  

system.time(test &lt;- data.mat[,testfunc(Var1,Var2,Var3),by=&quot;ID&quot;])  
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> user  system  elapsed

</blockquote>
<p>Comparing the results using data.table to the ones I got from using a for loop to subset all IDs and record results manually, they seem to have given me the same answers(though I'll have to check that a bit more thoroughly). That looks to be a pretty big speed increase.</p>

<h3>Update 3:</h3>
<p>I wanted to see if anything worked out differently using the plyr package that was also recommended. This is my first time using it, so I may have done things somewhat inefficiently, but it still helped substantially compared to the for loop with subsetting.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm creating a multiple-predictor linear model and generating diagnostic plots to assess regression assumptions. (It's for a multiple regression analysis stats class that I'm loving at the moment :-)</p>

<p>My textbook (Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken 2003) recommends plotting each predictor against the residuals to make sure that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The residuals don't systematically covary with the predictor</li>
<li>The residuals are homoscedastic with respect to each predictor in the model</li>
</ol>

<p>On point (2), my textbook has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some statistical packages allow the analyst to plot lowess fit lines at the mean of the residuals (0-line), 1 standard deviation above the mean, and 1 standard deviation below the mean of the residuals....In the present case {their example}, the two lines {mean + 1sd and mean - 1sd} remain roughly parallel to the lowess {0} line, consistent with the interpretation that the variance of the residuals does not change as a function of X. (p. 131)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>How can I modify loess lines?</h3>

<p>I know how to generate a scatterplot with a ""0-line,"":</p>

<pre><code>    # First, I'll make a simple linear model and get its diagnostic stats
    library(ggplot2)
    data(cars)
    mod &lt;- fortify(lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars))
    attach(mod)
    str(mod)

    # Now I want to make sure the residuals are homoscedastic
    qplot (x = dist, y = .resid, data = mod) + 
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE) # ""se = FALSE"" Removes the standard error bands
</code></pre>

<p>But does anyone know how I can use <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>qplot</code> to generate plots where the 0-line, ""mean + 1sd"" AND ""mean - 1sd"" lines would be superimposed? Is that a weird/complex question to be asking?</p>

I am studying economics, and my programming knowledge is virtually nonexistent, which is increasingly becoming a drawback.

<p>However, the eval.count column is incorrect and I need to fix it.  It should report the number of rows with the same values for (green.h.0, green.v.0, and offset.0) by only looking at the previous rows.</p>

<p>The example above uses the expected values, but assume they are incorrect.</p>

<p>How can I add a new column (say ""count"") which will count all previous rows which have the same values of the specified variables?</p>

<p>I have gotten help on a similar problem of just selecting all rows with the same values for specified columns, so I supposed I <em>could</em> just write a loop around that, but it seems inefficient to me.</p>

<p>Second, there must be a simpler way to reorganize my data to make this happen. It seems like the sort of thing I should be able to do natively in ggplot2 with plyR, but the documentation for plyR is not very clear (and I have read both the ggplot2 book and the online plyR documentation. </p>

### Create a second vector to label the first vector by original variable ###  
a1&lt;-rep(""News about Bangladesh"", length(int_newcoun))
a2&lt;-rep(""Neighboring Countries"", length(int_newneigh))

a17&lt;-rep(""Education"", length(int_educ))

### Create a Weighting vector of the proper length ###
Interest.weight&lt;-rep(weight, 17)

### Make and save a new data frame from the three vectors ###
Interest.df&lt;-cbind(Interest1, Interest2, Interest.weight)
Interest.df&lt;-as.data.frame(Interest.df)

write.csv(Interest.df, 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\[name]\\Desktop\\Sweave\\InterestBangladesh.csv')

### Sort the factor levels to display properly ###

<p>Here's pseudo-code for what I'm hoping to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>test.func &lt;- function(a, b) {
    # here I want to alter the b expression before evaluating it:
    b(..., val1=a)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Given the function call passed to <code>b</code>, I want to add in <code>a</code> as another parameter without needing to always specify <code>...</code> in the <code>b</code> call.  So the output from this <code>test.func</code> call should be:</p>

<pre><code>test.func(a=""a"", b=paste(1, 2))
""1""  ""2""  ""a""
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit</em>: </p>

<p>Another way I could see doing something like this would be if I could assign the additional parameter within the scope of the parent function (again, as pseudo-code); in this case <code>a</code> would be within the scope of t1 and hence t2, but not globally assigned:</p>

<pre><code>t2 &lt;- function(...) {
  paste(a=a, ...)
}

t1 &lt;- function(a, b) {
  local( { a &lt;&lt;- a; b } )
}

t1(a=""a"", b=t2(1, 2))
</code></pre>

<p>This is somewhat akin to currying in that I'm nesting the parameter within the function itself.</p>

<p><em>Edit 2</em>:</p>

<p>Just to add one more comment to this: I realize that one related approach could be to use ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prototype-based programming</a>"" such that things would be inherited (which could be achieved with <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/proto/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the proto package</a>).  But I was hoping for a easier way to simply alter the input parameters before evaluating in R.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just saw this (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1444306/how-to-use-outlier-tests-in-r-code"">How to use Outlier Tests in R Code</a>) and notice that Hadley recommends using a robust method such as rlm.   I am plotting bacterial growth curves, so I don't think a linear model is best, but any advice on  other models or using or using robust models in this situation would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far and is working nicely, but outliers are not removed:</p>

<pre><code>r &lt;- ggplot(data = data, aes(x = day, y = od))
r + geom_point(aes(group = replicate, color = series_id)) + # add points
   geom_line(aes(group = replicate, color = series_id)) + # add lines
   geom_smooth(aes(group = series_id))  # add smoother, average of each replicate
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: I just added two charts below showing examples of the outlier problems that I'm having from the real data rather than the example data above.</p>

<p>The first plots shows series p26s4 and around day 32 something really weird went on in two of the replicates, showing 2 outliers.</p>

<p>The second plots shows series p22s5 and on day 18, something weird went on with the reading that day, likely machine error I think.</p>

<p>At the moment I am eye-balling the data, to check that the growth curves look OK.  After taking Hadley's advice and setting family = ""symmetric"", I am confident that the loess smoother does a decent job of ignoring the outliers.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/koquF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/koquF.png"" alt=""p26s4 shows around day 32 something really weird went on in two of the replicates, showing 2 outliers""></a>

</p>

<p>@Peter/@hadley, the next thing I'd like to do is to try and fit a logistic, gompertz or richard's growth curve to this data instead of a loess and calculate the growth rate in the exponential stage.  Eventually I plan to use the grofit package in R (<a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grofit/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grofit/index.html</a>), but for now I'd like to plot these manually using ggplot2 if possible.  If you have any pointers then it would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Many R functions have an <strong><em>na.rm</em></strong> flag that when set to <em>TRUE</em>, remove the NAs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; v = mean( c(5, NA, 6, 12, NA, 87, 9, NA, 43, 67), na.rm=T)
&gt;&gt;&gt; v
      (5, 6, 12, 87, 9, 43, 67)
</code></pre>

<p>But if you want to deal with NAs <em>before</em> the function call, you need to do something like this:</p>

<p>to remove each 'NA' from a vector:</p>

<pre><code>vx = vx[!is.na(a)]
</code></pre>

<p>to remove each 'NA' from a vector and replace it w/ a '0':</p>

<pre><code>ifelse(is.na(vx), 0, vx)
</code></pre>

<p>to remove entire each row that contains 'NA' from a data frame:</p>

<pre><code>dfx = dfx[complete.cases(dfx),]
</code></pre>

<p>All of these functions permanently <em>remove</em> 'NA' or rows with an 'NA' in them.</p>

<p>Sometimes this isn't quite what you want though--making an 'NA'-excised copy of the data frame might be necessary for the next step in the workflow but in subsequent steps you often want those rows back (e.g., to calculate a column-wise statistic for a column that has missing rows caused by a prior call to 'complete cases' yet that column has no 'NA' values in it).</p>

<p>to be as clear as possible about what i'm looking for: python/numpy has a class, <em>masked array</em>, with a <em>mask</em> method, which lets you <strong>conceal</strong>--but not remove--NAs during a function call. Is there an analogous function in R?</p>

<p>Does anyone have advice on how to generate a vector of the appropriate length that would match the # of counties in NY, NJ, CT, and PA from the maps library? I want to merge the count data I have and include zeros for the counties I don't have information on.</p>

<p>I am trying to follow the tutorial described here: <a href=""http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2009/choropleths-in-r/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2009/choropleths-in-r/</a></p>

<p>The below code executes, but it is either not matching my dataset with the maps_counties data properly, or it isn't plotting it in the order I would expect. For example, the resulting areas for the greater NYC area show no density while random counties in PA show the highest density.</p>

<p>The general format of my data table is:</p>

fairfield connecticut 17
hartford connecticut 6
litchfield connecticut 3
new haven connecticut 12

westchester new york 70
yates new york 1
luzerne pennsylvania 1

<p>Note this data is in order by state and then county and includes data for CT, NJ, NY, &amp; PA. </p>

<p>First, I read in my data set:</p>

<pre><code>library(maps)
library(RColorBrewer)
d &lt;- read.table(""gissum.txt"", sep=""\t"", header=TRUE)

#Concatenate state and county info to match maps library
d$stcon &lt;- paste(d$state, d$county, sep="","")

#Color bins

d$colorBuckets &lt;- as.factor(as.numeric(cut(d$count,c(0,10,20,30,40,50,300))))
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my matching</p>

<pre><code>mapnames &lt;- map(""county"",plot=FALSE)[4]$names
colorsmatched &lt;- d$colorBuckets [na.omit(match(mapnames ,d$stcon))]
</code></pre>

<p>Plotting:</p>

<pre><code>map(""county""

<p>Right now, in my R project, I have <code>functions1.R</code> with <code>doFoo()</code> and <code>doBar()</code>, <code>functions2.R</code> with other functions, and <code>main.R</code> with the main program in it, which first does <code>source('functions1.R'); source('functions2.R')</code>, and then calls the other functions.</p>

<p>I've been starting the program from the R GUI in Mac OS X, with <code>source('main.R')</code>.  This is fine the first time, but after that, the variables that were defined the first time through the program are defined for the second time <code>functions*.R</code> are sourced, and so the functions get a whole bunch of extra variables defined.</p>

<p>I don't want that!  I want an ""undefined variable"" error when my function uses a variable it shouldn't!  Twice this has given me very late nights of debugging!</p>

<p>So how do other people deal with this sort of problem?  Is there something like <code>source()</code>, but that makes an independent namespace that doesn't fall through to the main one?  Making a package seems like one solution, but it seems like a big pain in the butt compared to e.g. Python, where a source file is automatically a separate namespace.</p>

<p>Any tips?  Thank you!</p>

<p>Now I have written a function which does exactly what I want BUT I had to take a detour which is possibly unnecessary and can be removed. However, somehow I am not able to locate
the shortcut.
Here is the function and the output for the posted data frame:</p>

<pre><code>fct.logDiff &lt;- function (df) {
df.log &lt;- dlply (df, ""code"", function(x) data.frame (p = x$p, log(x[, -c(1,2)])))
list.nalog &lt;- llply (df.log, function(x) data.frame (p = x$p, rbind(NA, sapply(x[,-1], diff))))
ldply (list.nalog, data.frame)
}

 fct.logDiff(df)
     id p        var1        var2        var3

</code></pre>

<p>The trouble is due to the added <code>NA</code>-rows. I don't want to collapse the frame and reduce it, which would be automatically done by the <code>diff()</code> function. So I had 10 rows in my original frame and am keeping the same amount of rows after the transformation. In order to keep the same length I had to add some <code>NAs</code>. I have taken a detour by transforming the data.frame into a list, add the <code>NAs</code> to each id's first line, and afterwards transform the list back into a data.frame. That looks tedious. </p>

<p>Any ideas to avoid the data.frame-list-data.frame class transformation and optimize the function?</p>

I want to try it out on my own data. The part that has me very excited is that one can use data stored in one's own Google spreadsheet as the data. One just signs into their Google Account so that yeroon.net/ggplot2 can access the spreadsheet list. I have been hesitant to do it. If I sign in whilst on yeroon.net am I handing over my username and password to a third party? It would not be wise of me to divulge my google password to third parties since Google is fast becoming my repository of everything. </p>

<p>How do I know if Jeroon's application is using <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthForInstalledApps.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ClientLogin</a> or <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuthForInstalledApps.html#"" rel=""noreferrer"">OAuth</a>? My understanding is very basic and may be wrong but nevertheless here it is. OAuth would be better since it does not actually pass the password onto the third party application. </p>

However, the covariates I have are all categorical, and worse, are all
nested. By this I mean that if a certain measurement has ""city -

""country - U.S."" I have four such factors - the most granular has
some 20k levels, but if need be I could do without that one, I think.
I also have a few non-nested categorical covariates (only four or so,
with maybe three different levels each).
What I am most interested in
is prediction - given a new observation in some city, I would like to
know the relevant probability/dependent variable. I am not interested
as much in the related inferential machinery - standard deviations,
etc - at least as of now. I am hoping I can afford to be sloppy.
However, I would love to have that information unless it requires
methods that are more computationally expensive.

In between the actual text and the data/code level, I'd like to insert another layer. Namely, I'd like to create a kind of automatically generated appendix that contains the full regression output, diagnostic plots, exploratory graphs data profiles etc. from the analysis, regardless of 
whether those plots/regressions etc. made it into the final paper.  </p>

<p>One idea I had was to write a script that would examine the .Rnw file and automatically: </p>

<ul>
<li>Profile all data sets that are loaded (sort of like the Hmisc(?) package)  </li>
<li>Summarize all regressions - i.e., run summary(model) for all models </li>
<li>Present all plots (regardless of whether they made it in the final version) </li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to make this kind of a low-effort, push-button sort of thing as opposed to a formal appendix written like the rest of a paper. What I'm looking for is some ideas on how to do this in R in a relatively simple way. My hunch is that there is some way of going through the namespace, figuring out what something is and then dumping into a PDF. </p>

<p>I would like the following code to work. To understand this code, know that the variable <code>path</code> contains the full path to my data set which, when loaded, gives me a variable called <code>immgen</code>. Know that <code>immgen</code> is an object (a Bioconductor <code>ExpressionSet</code> object) and that <code>exprs(immgen)</code> returns a data frame with 125 columns (experiments) and tens of thousands of rows (named genes). (Just in case it's not clear, this is Python code, using robjects.r to call R code)</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
# ... some code to build path
robjects.r(""load('%s')""%path) # loads immgen
e = robjects.r['data.frame'](""exprs(immgen)"")
expression_data = np.array(e)
</code></pre>

<p>This code runs, but <code>expression_data</code> is simply <code>array([[1]])</code>. </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that <code>e</code> doesn't represent the data frame generated by <code>exprs()</code> due to things like:</p>

<pre><code>In [40]: e._get_ncol()
Out[40]: 1

In [41]: e._get_nrow()
Out[41]: 1
</code></pre>

<p>But then again who knows? Even if <code>e</code> did represent my data.frame, that it doesn't convert straight to an array would be fair enough - a data frame has more in it than an array (rownames and colnames) and so maybe life shouldn't be this easy. However I still can't work out how to perform the conversion. The documentation is a bit too terse for me, though my limited understanding of the headings in the docs implies that this should be possible.</p>

<p>Anyone any thoughts?</p>

The data is from the M1-Competition, the series is MNB65. I am trying to fit the data to an ARIMA(1,0,0) model and get the forecasts. I am using R. Here are some output snippets:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; arima(x, order = c(1,0,0))
Series: x 
ARIMA(1,0,0) with non-zero mean 
Call: arima(x = x, order = c(1, 0, 0))

      0.9421  12260.298
s.e.  0.0474    202.717

&gt; predict(arima(x, order = c(1,0,0)), n.ahead=12)

</code></pre>

<p>I have a few questions:</p>

<p>(1) How do I explain that although the dataset shows a clear downward trend, the forecast from this model trends upward? This also happens for ARIMA(2,0,0), which is the best ARIMA fit for the data using <code>auto.arima</code> (forecast package) and for an ARIMA(1,0,1) model.</p>

<p>(2) The intercept value for the ARIMA(1,0,0) model is 12260.298. Shouldn't the intercept satisfy the equation: <code>C = mean * (1 - sum(AR coeffs))</code>, in which case, the value should be <code>715.52</code>. I must be missing something basic here.</p>

<p>(3) This is clearly a series with non-stationary mean. Why is an AR(2) model still selected as the best model by <code>auto.arima</code>? Could there be an intuitive explanation?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

My variable <code>p</code> has, say, <em>m</em> rows and <em>n</em> columns. For every row there is strictly only one <code>TRUE</code> element.</p>

<p>It also has column names, which are strings. What I would like to do is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>For every row in <code>p</code> I see a <code>TRUE</code> I would like to replace with the name of the corresponding column</li>

<p>but theres's no beauty here and I have totally subscribed to this for-loops-in-R-are-probably-wrong mentality. Maybe wrong is too strong but they're certainly not great.</p>

<p>I don't really know how to do step 2. I kind of hoped that the sum of a string and <code>FALSE</code> would return the string but it doesn't. I kind of hoped I could use an OR operator of some kind but can't quite figure that out (Python responds to <code>False or 'bob'</code> with <code>'bob'</code>).

<p>The solution, as provided by learnr, was to add scale_x_continuous(breaks = NA), but this had the side effect of also suppressing the x-axis labels, as well.  I am totally happy to write the labels back in by hand, but it's not clear to me how to figure out where the labels should go.</p>

<p>The other option is to suppress all gridlines (using opts( panel.grid.major = theme_blank()) or some such) and then drawing back in just the major horizontal gridlines.  Again, the problem here is how to figure out what the breaks are in the plot to supply to geom_hline().</p>

<p>So, essentially, my options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Suppress vertical gridlines and x-axis labels (using scale_x_continuous(breaks = NA) ) and add the x-axis labels back in.</li>
<li>Suppress all gridlines (using opts( panel.grid.major = theme_blank()) ) and add the major horizontal gridlines back in using geom_hline().</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the two options:</p>

<pre><code>library(ggplot2)

data &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = c(3,5,2,5,6,2,7,6,5,4))

# suppressing vertical gridlines and x-axis labels
# need to re-draw x-axis labels
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NA) +
  opts(
    panel.grid.major = theme_line(size = 0.5, colour = '#1391FF'),
    panel.grid.minor = theme_blank(),
    panel.background = theme_blank(),
    axis.ticks = theme_blank()
  )

# suppressing all gridlines
# need to re-draw horizontal gridlines, probably with geom_hbar() 
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NA) +
  opts(
    panel.grid.major = theme_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = theme_blank(),
    panel.background = theme_blank(),

"2685127","1","","","2010-04-21 17:25:34","","0","849","<p>I'm a student working on an epidemiology model in R, using maximum likelihood methods. I created my negative log likelihood function. It's sort of gross looking, but here it is:</p>

<pre><code>NLLdiff = function(v1, CV1, v2, CV2, st1 = (czI01 - czV01), st2 = (czI02 - czV02), st01 = czI01, st02 = czI02, tt1 = czT01, tt2 = czT02) { 
    prob1 = (1 + v1 * CV1 * tt1)^(-1/CV1)
    prob2 = ( 1 + v2 * CV2 * tt2)^(-1/CV2) 
    -(sum(dbinom(st1, st01, prob1, log = T)) + sum(dbinom(st2, st02, prob2, log = T)))
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The reason the first line looks so awful is because most of the data it takes is input there. <code>czI01</code>, for example, is already declared. I did this simply so that my later calls to the function don't all have to have awful vectors in them.</p>

<p>I then optimized for CV1, CV2, v1 and v2 using mle2 (library bbmle). That's also a bit gross looking, and looks like:</p>

<pre><code>ml.cz.diff = mle2 (NLLdiff, start=list(v1 = vguess, CV1 = cguess, v2 = vguess, CV2 = cguess), method=""L-BFGS-B"", lower = 0.0001)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, everything works fine up until here. ml.cz.diff gives me values that I can turn into a plot that reasonably fits my data. I also have several different models, and can get AICc values to compare them. However, when I try to get confidence intervals around v1, CV1, v2 and CV2 I have problems. Basically, I get a negative bound on CV1, which is impossible as it actually represents a square number in the biological model as well as some warnings.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to get confidence intervals? Or, really, a way to get confidence intervals that make sense here? </p>

<p>What I see happening is that, by coincidence, my hessian matrix is singular for some values in the optimization space. But, since I'm optimizing over 4 variables and don't have overly extensive programming knowledge, I can't come up with a good method of optimization that doesn't rely on the hessian. I have googled the problem - it suggested that my model's bad, but I'm reconstructing some work done before which suggests that my model's really not awful (the plots I make using the ml.cz.diff look like the plots of the original work). I have also read the relevant parts of the manual as well as Bolker's book <em>Ecological Models in R</em>. I have also tried different optimization methods, which resulted in a longer run time but the same errors. The ""SANN"" method didn't finish running within an hour, so I didn't wait around to see the result.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: my confidence intervals are bad.  Is there a relatively straightforward way to fix them in R?</p>

<p>My vectors are: </p>

<pre><code>czT01 = c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50)
czT02 = c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75)
czI01 = c(25, 24, 22, 22, 26, 23, 25, 25, 25, 23, 25, 18, 21, 24, 22, 23, 25, 23, 25, 25, 25)
czI02 = c(13, 16, 5, 18, 16, 13, 17, 22, 13, 15, 15, 22, 12, 12, 13, 13, 11, 19, 21, 13, 21, 18, 16, 15, 11)
czV01 = c(1, 4, 5, 5, 2, 3, 4, 11, 8, 1, 11, 12, 10, 16, 5, 15, 18, 12, 23, 13, 22)
czV02 = c(0, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 3, 4, 7, 12, 2, 8, 8, 5, 3, 6, 4, 6, 11, 5, 11, 1, 13, 9, 7)
</code></pre>

<p>and I get my guesses by:</p>

<pre><code>v = -log((c(czI01, czI02) - c(czV01, czV02))/c(czI01, czI02))/c(czT01, czT02)
vguess = mean(v)
cguess = var(v)/vguess^2
</code></pre>

<p>It's also possible that I'm doing something else completely wrong, but my results seem reasonable so I haven't caught it.</p>

Converting them to character vectors doesn't help.</p>

<p>Background (because I wouldn't mind help on this, either): I have records of drug treatments given to patients.  Each treatment record essentially specifies a person and a date.  A second table has a record for each drug and dose given during a particular treatment (usually, a few drugs are given each treatment).  I'm trying to identify contiguous periods during which the person was taking the same combinations of drugs at the same doses.</p>

<p>The best plan I've come up with is to check the treatments chronologically.

<p>I however would like to do this a bit more efficient. One solution could be to use the ""doMC"" and the ""foreach"" package but this is not possible in R on a Windows machine.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>library(""foreach"")
library(""strucchange"")
library(""doMC"") # would this be possible on a windows machine?
registerDoMC(2)  # for a computer with two cores (processors)
## Nile data with one breakpoint: the annual flows drop in 1898
## because the first Ashwan dam was built
data(""Nile"")
plot(Nile)

## F statistics indicate one breakpoint
fs.nile &lt;- Fstats(Nile ~ 1)
plot(fs.nile)
breakpoints(fs.nile)     # , hpc = ""foreach"" --&gt; It would be great to test this.

For example: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://github.com/hadley/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://github.com/hadley/</a></li>
<li>See comments on <a href=""http://permut.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/revision-control-statistics-bleg/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://permut.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/revision-control-statistics-bleg/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However, I'm evaluating whether adopting a version control system such as git would be worthwhile.</p>

<p><b>A brief overview:</b>
I'm a social scientist who uses R to analyse data for research publications.
I don't currently produce R packages.
My R code for a project typically includes a few thousand lines of code for data input, cleaning, manipulation, analyses, and output generation.
Publications are typically written using LaTeX.</p>

<p>With regards to version control there are many benefits which I have read about, yet they seem to be less relevant to the solo data analyst.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Backup:</b> I have a backup system already in place. </li>
<li><b>Forking and rewinding:</b> I've never felt the need to do this, 
   but I can see how it could be useful (e.g., you are preparing multiple 
  journal articles based on the same dataset; you are preparing a report 
  that is updated monthly, etc)</li>
<li><b>Collaboration:</b> Most of the time I am
analysing data myself, thus, I
wouldn't get the collaboration
benefits of version control.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also several potential costs involved with adopting version control:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time to evaluate and learn a version control system</li>
<li>A possible increase in complexity over my current file management system</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I still have the feeling that I'm missing something.
General guides on version control seem to be addressed more towards computer scientists than data analysts.</p>

<p>Thus, specifically <b>in relation to data analysts</b> in circumstances similar to those listed above:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is version control worth the effort?</li>
<li>What are the main pros and cons of adopting version control? </li>
<li>What is a good strategy for getting started with version control
 for data analysis with R (e.g., examples, workflow ideas, software, links to guides)?</li>
</ol>

<p>I was thinking that the dim() of the 3rd dimension would be 3, but instead, it is 2. Really this is a sliced up version of the covariance matrix for each group.  If we manually compute the sample covariance matrix for aa, we get:</p>

<pre><code>           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  1.4961210 -0.9496134
[2,] -0.9496134  2.8815146
</code></pre>

<p>Using plyr, the following gives me what I want in list() form:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; dlply(mydata, c(""SNP1""), function(df) cov(cbind(df$X1, df$X2)))
$aa
           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  1.4961210 -0.9496134
[2,] -0.9496134  2.8815146

$Aa
           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  0.8833190 -0.1640711
[2,] -0.1640711  2.4661046

$AA
           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  0.9942357 -0.9955837
[2,] -0.9955837  4.9383196

attr(,""split_type"")
[1] ""data.frame""
attr(,""split_labels"")
  SNP1
1   aa
2   Aa
3   AA
</code></pre>

<p>But like I said earlier, I would really like this in a 3D array. Any thoughts on where I went wrong with daply() or suggestions? Of course, I could typecast the list from dlply() to a 3D array, but I'd rather not do this because I will be repeating this process many times in a simulation.</p>

<p>As a side note, I found one method (<a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/r-help@r-project.org/msg86328.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mail-archive.com/r-help@r-project.org/msg86328.html</a>) that provides the sample covariance matrix for each group, but the outputted object is bloated. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><code>data.frame(Column1=rnorm(10))</code></p>

<p>Here's what happens when I try it:</p>

<p>How can I feed that item from the vector into the <code>data.frame()</code> command?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>For some background, I have defined a function <code>calc.means()</code> that takes a data frame and a list of variables and performs a large and complicated ddply operation, summarizing at the level specified by the variables. </p>

<p>What I'm trying to do with the <code>data.frame()</code> command is walk back up the aggregation levels to the very top, re-running <code>calc.means()</code> at each step and using <code>rbind()</code> to glue the results onto one another. I need to add dummy columns with 'All' values in order to get the rbind to work properly. </p>

<p>I'm rolling <code>cast</code>-like margin functionality into ddply, basically, and I'd like to not retype the column names for each run. Here's the full code:</p>

<pre><code>cols &lt;- c('Col1','Col2','Col3')
rbind ( calc.means(dat,cols),

<p>our process for describing new functionality: we define new unit tests, initially marked as <code>DEACTIVATED</code>; one block of tests at a time we activate them and implement the function described by the tests.  almost all the time we have a small amount of DEACTIVATED tests, relative to functions that might be dropped or will be implemented.</p>

<p>my problem/question is: can I alter the <a href=""http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:runit#another_approach_using_svunit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doSvUnit.R</a> so that <code>R CMD check pkg</code> emits a NOTE (i.e. a custom message ""NOTE"" instead of ""OK"") in case there are DEACTIVATED tests?  </p>

<p>as of now, we see only that the active tests don't give error:</p>

<pre><code>.
.
* checking for unstated dependencies in tests ... OK
* checking tests ...
  Running ‘doSvUnit.R’
 OK
* checking PDF version of manual ... OK
</code></pre>

<p>which is all right if all tests succeed, but less all right if there are skipped tests and definitely wrong if there are failing tests.  In this case, I'd actually like to see a NOTE or a WARNING like the following:</p>

<pre><code>.
.
* checking for unstated dependencies in tests ... OK
* checking tests ...
  Running ‘doSvUnit.R’
 NOTE
6 test(s) were skipped.
 WARNING
1 test(s) are failing.
* checking PDF version of manual ... OK
</code></pre>

<p>As of now, we have to open the <code>doSvUnit.Rout</code> to check the real test results.</p>

<hr>

<p>I contacted two of the maintainers at r-forge and CRAN and they pointed me to the <a href=""https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sources of R</a>, in particular the <a href=""https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/testing.R"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>testing.R</code></a> script.</p>

<p>if I understand it correctly, to answer this question we need patching the <code>tools</code> package: </p>

<ul>
<li>scripts in the tests directory are called using a <code>system</code> call,</li>
<li>output (stdout and stderr) go to one single file,</li>
<li>there are two possible outcomes: <strong>ok</strong> or <strong>not ok</strong>,</li>
</ul>

<p>so I opened a <a href=""https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14702"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">change request</a> on R, proposing something like bit-coding the return status, bit-0 for ERROR (as it is now), bit-1 for WARNING, bit-2 for NOTE.  </p>

<p>with my modification, it would be easy producing this output:</p>

<pre><code>.
.
* checking for unstated dependencies in tests ... OK
* checking tests ...
  Running ‘doSvUnit.R’
 NOTE - please check doSvUnit.Rout.
 WARNING - please check doSvUnit.Rout.
* checking PDF version of manual ... OK

And this becomes frustrating when you experiment with new graphs, especially when code gets a bit lengthy... so searching through history file isn't quite convenient way of doing this... Is there a more efficient way of doing this? Just an illustration:</p>

<pre><code>p &lt;- qplot(data = mtcars, x = factor(cyl), geom = ""bar"", fill = factor(cyl)) + 
     scale_fill_manual(name = ""Cylinders"", value = c(""firebrick3"", ""gold2"", ""chartreuse3"")) + 
     stat_bin(aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.2, geom = ""text"", position = ""identity"") + 
     xlab(""# of cylinders"") + ylab(""Frequency"") + 
     opts(title = ""Barplot: # of cylinders"")
</code></pre>

<p>I can get some basic info with <code>summary</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; summary(p)
data: mpg, cyl, disp, hp, drat, wt, qsec, vs, am, gear, carb [32x11]
mapping:  fill = factor(cyl), x = factor(cyl)
scales:   fill 
faceting: facet_grid(. ~ ., FALSE)

geom_bar:  
stat_bin:  
position_stack: (width = NULL, height = NULL)

mapping: label = ..count.. 
geom_text: vjust = -0.2 
stat_bin: width = 0.9, drop = TRUE, right = TRUE 
position_identity: (width = NULL, height = NULL)

<p>But I want to get code I typed in to get the graph. I reckon that I'm missing something essential here... it's seems impossible that there's no way to get call from <code>ggplot</code> object!</p>

<p>I am trying to calculate the cumulative standard deviation of a matrix. I want a function that accepts a matrix and returns a matrix of the same size where output cell (i,j) is set to the standard deviation of input column j between rows 1 and i. NAs should be ignored, unless cell (i,j) of the input matrix itself is NA, in which case cell (i,j) of the output matrix should also be NA.</p>

<p>I could not find a built-in function, so I implemented the following code. Unfortunately, this uses a loop that ends up being somewhat slow for large matrices. Is there a faster built-in function or can someone suggest a better approach?</p>

    retval &lt;- mat*NA

<h3>The Coding Scheme</h3>

<p>I'm analyzing data from a university science course exam. We're looking at patterns in
student responses, and we developed a coding scheme to represent the kinds of things
students are doing in their answers. A subset of the coding scheme is shown below.</p>

<p><a
href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0tut3kR-JFoB0cP_0uFBZg?feat=embedwebsite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img
src=""http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TvbgXH78cQc/S-CknUrDwuI/AAAAAAAACGo/0umklpa2968/s400/StackOverflowQuestion20100504.001.png""
/></a></p>

<p>Note that within each major code (1, 2, 3) are nested non-unique sub-codes (a, b, ...).</p>

<h3>What the Raw Data Looks Like</h3>

<p>I've created an anonymized, raw subset of my actual data which you can view <a href=""http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BypDSvtB33v7MjQ0OTBmYjQtMjBlYy00MDJjLWJmZmQtMjkxM2VhMDNmMGFl&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.
Part of my problem is that those who coded the data noticed that some students displayed
multiple patterns. The coders' solution was to create enough columns (<code>reason1</code>, <code>reason2</code>,
...) to hold students with multiple patterns. That becomes important because the order
(<code>reason1</code>, <code>reason2</code>) is arbitrary--two students (like student 41 and student 42 in my
<a href=""http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BypDSvtB33v7MjQ0OTBmYjQtMjBlYy00MDJjLWJmZmQtMjkxM2VhMDNmMGFl&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dataset</a>) who correctly applied ""dependency"" should both register in an analysis, regardless of
whether <code>3a</code> appears in the <code>reason</code> column or the <code>reason2</code> column.</p>

<h3>How Can I Best Structure Student Data?</h3>

<p>Part of my problem is that in the <a href=""http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BypDSvtB33v7MjQ0OTBmYjQtMjBlYy00MDJjLWJmZmQtMjkxM2VhMDNmMGFl&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">raw data</a>, not all students display the same
patterns, or the same number of them, in the same order. Some students may do just one
thing, others may do several. So, an abstracted representation of example students might
look like this:</p>

<p><a
href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sQgGKgseA07Z_lKxRe4fkQ?feat=embedwebsite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img

/></a></p>

<p>Note in the example above that <code>student002</code> and <code>student003</code> both are coded as ""1b"", although I've deliberately shown the order as different to reflect the reality of <a href=""http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BypDSvtB33v7MjQ0OTBmYjQtMjBlYy00MDJjLWJmZmQtMjkxM2VhMDNmMGFl&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my data</a>.</p>

<h3>My (Practical) Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Should I concatenate <code>reason1</code>, <code>reason2</code>, <code>...</code> into one column?</li>
<li>How can I (re)code the <code>reason</code>s in R to reflect the multiplicity for some students?</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>library('GEOquery')
GDS = getGEO('GDS785')
cd4T = GDS2eSet(GDS)
cd4T &lt;- cd4T[!fData(cd4T)$symbol == """",]
</code></pre>

<p>Now cd4T is an ExpressionSet object which wraps a big matrix with 19794 rows (probesets) and 15 columns (samples). The final line gets rid of all probesets that do not have corresponding gene symbols. Now the trouble is that most genes in this set are assigned to more than one probeset. You can see this by doing</p>

<pre><code>gene_symbols = factor(fData(cd4T)$Gene.symbol)
length(gene_symbols)-length(levels(gene_symbols))
[1] 6897
</code></pre>

<p>So only 6897 of my 19794 probesets have unique probeset -> gene mappings. I'd like to somehow combine the expression levels of each probeset associated with each gene. I don't care much about the actual probe id for each probe. I'd like very much to end up with an ExpressionSet containing the merged information as all of my downstream analysis is designed to work with this class. </p>

<p>I think I can write some code that will do this by hand, and make a new expression set from scratch. However, I'm assuming this can't be a new problem and that code exists to do it, using a statistically sound method to combine the gene expression levels. I'm guessing there's a proper name for this also but my googles aren't showing up much of use. Can anyone help?</p>

One such system is based on the rebate on loss. You basically have a large master pot, say $1 million. Your bankroll for each game is $50k.</p>

<p>The way it works, is as follows:
1) Start with $50k, always bet on banker
2) If you win, add the money to the master pot. Then play again with $50k.
3) If you lose(now you're at $30k) play till you either: 
(a) hit 0, you get a rebate of 10%. Begin playing again with $50k+5k=$55k.
(b) If you win more than the initial bankroll, add the money to the master pot. Then play again with $50k.
4) Continue until you double the master pot.</p>

<p>I just cant find an easy way of programming out the possible cases in R, since you can eventually go down an improbable path.</p>

<p>For example, you start at 50k, lose 20, win 19, now you're at 49, now you lose 20, lose 20, now youre at 9, you either lose 9 and get back 5k or you win and this cycle continues until you either end up with more than 50k or hit 0 and get the rebate on the 50k and start again with $50k +5k.</p>

<p>Here's some code i started, but i havent figured out a good way of handling the cases where you get stuck and keeping track of the number of games played. Thanks again for your help. Obviously, I understand you may be busy and not have time.</p>

Conversely, if someone had a sequence of ""Negative"", ""Indeterminate"", ""Negative"", that should be stable.</p>

<p>It's the latter part that I'm stuck on; if it were just a sequence of comparisons per participant, I'd be all right, but I'm having trouble thinking about how to elegantly deal with these variable comparison pairs.  Your help is, as always, much appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a dataframe that contains a field representing an ID label.  This label has two parts, an alpha  prefix and a numeric suffix.  I want to split it apart and create two new fields with these values in.</p>

<pre><code>structure(list(lab = c(""N00"", ""N01"", ""N02"", ""B00"", ""B01"", ""B02"",

<p>It would also be helpful if I could figure out how to extract the matrix that plm() is using when it does a regression. For instance, you could use plm to do fixed effects, or you could create a matrix with the appropriate dummy variables and then run that through glm().

There is no a priori theory to choose the specification of the model so one of the key tasks is dimension reduction before running the regression. While I am aware of several methods for dimension reduction for continuous variables I am not aware of a similar statical literature for categorical data (except, perhaps, as a part of correspondence analysis which is basically a variation of principal component analysis on frequency table). Let me also add that the dataset is of moderate size 500000 observations with 200 variables. I have two questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a good statistical reference out there for dimension reduction for categorical data along with robust imputation (I think the first issue is imputation and then dimension reduction)?</li>
<li>This is linked to implementation of above problem. I have used R extensively earlier and tend to use transcan and impute function heavily for continuous variables and use a variation of tree method to impute categorical values. I have a working knowledge of Python so if something is nice out there for this purpose then I will use it. Any implementation pointers in python or R will be of great help.
Thank you.</li>

<p>I'd like to concatenate the rows of this data frame (this will be another question). But look:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; class(bob$phenotype)
[1] ""factor""
</code></pre>

<p><code>Bob</code>'s columns are factors. So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; as.character(head(bob))
[1] ""c(3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6)""       ""c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)""      
[3] ""c(29, 29, 29, 30, 30, 30)""
</code></pre>

<p>I don't begin to understand this, but I guess these are indices into the levels of the factors of the columns (of the court of king caractacus) of <code>bob</code>? Not what I need.</p>

<p>Strangely I can go through the columns of <code>bob</code> by hand, and do</p>

<pre><code>bob$phenotype &lt;- as.character(bob$phenotype)
</code></pre>

<p>which works fine. And, after some typing, I can get a data.frame whose columns are characters rather than factors. So my question is: how can I do this automatically? How do I convert a data.frame with factor columns into a data.frame with character columns without having to manually go through each column? </p>

<p>Bonus question: why does the manual approach work?</p>

<p>I simply want to generate lags for QTY, SALES, INVOICE for each product but I am not sure where to start.  I know R is great with Time Series, but I am not sure where to start.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have the raw invoice data but have aggregated it for reporting purposes.  Would it be easier if I didn't aggregate the data?</p></li>
<li><p>Regardless of aggregation or not, what functions will I need to loop over each product and generate the lags as I need them?  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>In short, I want to loop over a set of records, calculate lags for a product (if possible), append the lags (as they apply) to the current record for each product, and write the results back to a table in my database for my reporting software to use.</p>

<p>I have climate data (temperature, precipitation, snow depth) for all of Canada between 1900 and 2009. I have written a basic website and the simplest page allows users to choose category and city. They then get back a very simple report (without the parameters and calculations section):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/7eQ45.png"" /></p>

<p>The primary purpose of the web application is to provide a simple user interface so that the general public can explore the data in meaningful ways. (A list of numbers is not meaningful to the general public, nor is a website that provides <a href=""http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/CDODivisionalSelect.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">too many inputs</a>.) The secondary purpose of the application is to provide climatologists and other scientists with deeper ways to view the data. (Using too many inputs, of course.)</p>

<h3>Tool Set</h3>

<p>The database is PostgreSQL with R (mostly) installed. The reports are written using iReport and generated using JasperReports.</p>

<h3>Poor Model Choice</h3>

<p>Currently, a linear regression model is applied against annual averages of daily data. The linear regression model is calculated within a PostgreSQL function as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  regr_slope( amount, year_taken ),
  regr_intercept( amount, year_taken ),
  corr( amount, year_taken )
FROM
  temp_regression
INTO STRICT slope, intercept, correlation;
</code></pre>

<p>The results are returned to JasperReports using:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  year_taken,
  amount,
  year_taken * slope + intercept,
  slope,
  intercept,
  correlation,
  total_measurements
INTO result;
</code></pre>

<p>JasperReports calls into PostgreSQL using the following parameterized analysis function:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  year_taken,
  amount,
  measurements,
  regression_line,
  slope,
  intercept,
  correlation,
  total_measurements,
  execute_time
FROM
  climate.analysis(
    $P{CityId},
    $P{Elevation1},
    $P{Elevation2},
    $P{Radius},
    $P{CategoryId},
    $P{Year1},
    $P{Year2}
  )
ORDER BY year_taken
</code></pre>

<p>This is not an optimal solution because it gives the false impression that the climate is changing at a slow, but steady rate. </p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>Using functions that take two parameters (e.g., year [X] and amount [Y]), such as PostgreSQL's <code>regr_slope</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a better regression model to apply?</li>
<li>What CPAN-R packages provide such models? (Installable, ideally, using <code>apt-get</code>.)</li>
<li>How can the R functions be called within a PostgreSQL function?</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such functions exist:</p>

<ul>
<li>What parameters should I try to obtain for functions that will produce the desired fit?</li>
<li>How would you recommend showing the best fit curve?</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that this is a web app for use by the general public. If the only way to analyse the data is from an R shell, then the purpose has been defeated. (I know this is not the case for most R functions I have looked at so far.)</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<li>Listing the R packages and functions available to PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>Installing a package (such as <a href=""http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/Kendall/html/Kendall.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kendall</a>) for use with PL/R</li>
<li>Calling an R function within PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>

<h3>Listing Available R Packages</h3>

<p><strong>Q.1.</strong> How do you find out what R modules have been loaded?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM r_typenames();
</code></pre>

<p>That shows the types that are available, but what about checking if <code>Kendall( X, Y )</code> is loaded? For example, the <a href=""http://www.joeconway.com/plr/doc/plr-module-funcs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> shows:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE plr_modules (
  modseq int4,
  modsrc text
);
</code></pre>

<p>That seems to allow inserting records to dictate that <code>Kendall</code> is to be loaded, but the following code doesn't explain, syntactically, how to ensure that it gets loaded:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO plr_modules
  VALUES (0, 'pg.test.module.load &lt;-function(msg) {print(msg)}');
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Q.2.</strong> What would the above line look like if you were trying to load <code>Kendall</code>?<br />
<strong>Q.3.</strong> Is it applicable?</p>

<h3>Installing R Packages</h3>

<p>Using the ""synaptic"" package manager the following packages have been installed:</p>

<pre><code>r-base
r-base-core
r-base-dev
r-base-html
r-base-latex
r-cran-acepack
r-cran-boot
r-cran-car
r-cran-chron
r-cran-cluster
r-cran-codetools
r-cran-design
r-cran-foreign
r-cran-hmisc
r-cran-kernsmooth
r-cran-lattice
r-cran-matrix
r-cran-mgcv
r-cran-nlme
r-cran-quadprog
r-cran-robustbase
r-cran-rpart
r-cran-survival
r-cran-vr
r-recommended
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Q.4.</strong> How do I know if Kendall is in there?<br />
<strong>Q.5.</strong> If it isn't, how do I find out what package it is in?<br />
<strong>Q.6.</strong> If it isn't in a package suitable for installing with <code>apt-get</code> (<code>aptitude</code>, <code>synaptic</code>, <code>dpkg</code>, what have you), how do I go about installing it on Ubuntu?<br />
<strong>Q.7.</strong> Where are the installation steps documented?<br /></p>

<h3>Calling R Functions</h3>

<p>I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>EXECUTE 'SELECT '
  'regr_slope( amount, year_taken ),'
  'regr_intercept( amount, year_taken ),'
  'corr( amount, year_taken ),'
  'sum( measurements ) AS total_measurements '
'FROM temp_regression'
INTO STRICT slope, intercept, correlation, total_measurements;
</code></pre>

<p>This code calls the PostgreSQL function <code>corr</code> to calculate Pearson's correlation over the data. Ideally, I'd like to do the following (by switching <code>corr</code> for <code>plr_kendall</code>):</p>

<pre><code>EXECUTE 'SELECT '
  'regr_slope( amount, year_taken ),'
  'regr_intercept( amount, year_taken ),'
  'plr_kendall( amount, year_taken ),'
  'sum( measurements ) AS total_measurements '
'FROM temp_regression'
INTO STRICT slope, intercept, correlation, total_measurements;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Q.8.</strong> Do I have to write <code>plr_kendall</code> myself?<br />
<strong>Q.9.</strong> Where can I find a <em>simple</em> example that walks through:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loading an R module into PG.</li>
<li>Writing a PG wrapper for the desired R function.</li>
<li>Calling the PG wrapper from a SELECT.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, would the last two steps look like:</p>

<pre><code>create or replace function plr_kendall( _float8, _float8 ) returns float as '
  agg_kendall(arg1, arg2)
' language 'plr';

CREATE AGGREGATE agg_kendall (
  sfunc = plr_array_accum,
  basetype = float8, -- ???
  stype = _float8, -- ???
  finalfunc = plr_kendall
);
</code></pre>

<p>And then the <code>SELECT</code> as above?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

Also, for my purposes, I would need tens of thousands of twitts.  Is it even possible to get them in retrospect?? (for example, asking older posts each time through the API URL ?)  If not, there is the more general question of how to create a personal storage of twitts on your home computer? (a question which might be better left to another SO thread - although any insights from people here would be very interesting for me to read)</p></li>
<li><p>How to parse the information (in R)? I know that R has functions that could help from  the rcurl and twitteR packages.  But I don't know which, or how to use them.  Any suggestions would be of help.</p></li>
<li><p>How to analyse?  how to remove all the ""not interesting"" words?  I found that the ""tm"" package in R has <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/vignettes/tm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this example</a>:</p>

<p>reuters &lt;- tm_map(reuters, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))</p>

<p>Would this do the trick?  I should I do something else/more ?</p>

<p>Also, I imagine I would like to do that after cutting my dataset according to time (which will require some posix-like functions (which I am not exactly sure which would be needed here, or how to use it).</p></li>
<li><p>And lastly, there is the question of visualization.  How do I create a tag cloud of the words?

It does not need to be customizable but it must be able to recognize statements separated by either semicolons or newlines since this code has both. If it can put all statements on a separate line, consistently indent code blocks and consistently place braces I will be very happy.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: summarizing findings</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the great answers. Here is what I've found.</p>

<ul>
<li>Both ESS and StatET are great R editors and do a nice job of auto indenting blocks of code. StatET allows you to select-all and re-indent everything in a file at once. From what I could tell ESS allows you to indent an entire function def at once but not the entire file (please correct me if I missed it). Neither of these will fix brace placement or break up multi-statement lines. (Eg: i = n*b;a=i+1)</li>
<li>formatR is awesome. In addition to fixing indentation it will also place braces consistently and split up multi-statement lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a little function I wrote so that I can convert an entire source dir (using the same underlying function as formatR which is strangely in the animation package).</p>

<pre><code>library(""animation"")

tidy.all &lt;- function(inDir = NULL, outDir = NULL, ...) {
    if (is.null(inDir) || is.na(outDir)) 
        stop(""inDir can't be null or NA"")
    if (!file.info(inDir)$isdir) 
        stop(""inDir must be a directory"")

    if (is.null(outDir) || is.na(outDir)) 
        stop(""outDir can't be null or NA"")
    if (!file.exists(outDir)) 
        dir.create(outDir)
    if (!file.info(outDir)$isdir) 
        stop(""outDir must be a directory"")

    for (f in dir(inDir)) {
        currFile &lt;- file.path(inDir, f)

<p>I have two groups of points, <code>data</code> and <code>centers</code>, the first one of size <code>n</code> and the second of size <code>K</code> (for instance, <code>n = 3823</code> and <code>K = 10</code>), and for each <code>i</code> in the first set, I need to find <code>j</code> in the second with the minimum distance.</p>

<p>My idea is simple: for each <code>i</code>, let <code>dist[j]</code> be the distance between <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, I only need to use <code>which.min(dist)</code> to find what I am looking for.</p>

<p>Each point is an array of <code>64</code> doubles, so </p>

<pre><code>&gt; dim(data)
[1] 3823   64
&gt; dim(centers)
[1] 10 64
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried with</p>

<pre><code>for (i in 1:n) {
  for (j in 1:K) {
    d[j] &lt;- sqrt(sum((centers[j,] - data[i,])^2))
  }
  S[i] &lt;- which.min(d)
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is extremely slow (with <code>n = 200</code>, it takes more than 40s!!). The fastest solution that I wrote is</p>

<pre><code>distance &lt;- function(point, group) {
  return(dist(t(array(c(point, t(group)), dim=c(ncol(group), 1+nrow(group)))))[1:nrow(group)])
}

for (i in 1:n) {
  d &lt;- distance(data[i,], centers)
  which.min(d)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even if it does a lot of computation that I don't use (because <code>dist(m)</code> computes the distance between all rows of <code>m</code>), it is way more faster than the other one (can anyone explain why?), but it is not fast enough for what I need, because it will not be used only once. And also, the <code>distance</code> code is very ugly. I tried to replace it with</p>

<pre><code>distance &lt;- function(point, group) {
  return (dist(rbind(point,group))[1:nrow(group)])
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this seems to be twice slower. I also tried to use <code>dist</code> for each pair, but it is also slower.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do now. It seems like I am doing something very wrong. Any idea on how to do this more efficiently?</p>

<p>ps: I need this to implement k-means by hand (and I need to do it, it is part of an assignment). I believe I will only need Euclidian distance, but I am not yet sure, so I will prefer to have some code where the distance computation can be replaced easily. <code>stats::kmeans</code> do all computation in less than one second.</p>

The main object returned is a matrix ""qr"" that contains in the upper triangular matrix R (i.e. <code>R=qr[upper.tri(qr)]</code>). So far so good. The lower triangular part of qr contains Q ""in compact form"". One can extract Q from the qr decomposition by using <code>qr.Q()</code>. I would like to find the inverse of <code>qr.Q()</code>.

(multi)collinearity refers to extremely high correlations between predictors in the regression model. How to cure them... well, sometimes you don't need to ""cure"" collinearity, since it doesn't affect regression model itself, but interpretation of an effect of individual predictors.</p>

<p>One way to spot collinearity is to put each predictor as a dependent variable, and other predictors as independent variables, determine R<sup>2</sup>, and if it's larger than .9 (or .95), we can consider predictor redundant. This is one ""method""... what about other approaches? Some of them are time consuming, like excluding predictors from model and watching for b-coefficient changes - they should be noticeably different.</p>

<p>Of course, we must always bear in mind the specific context/goal of the analysis... Sometimes, only remedy is to repeat a research, but right now, I'm interested in various ways of screening redundant predictors when (multi)collinearity occurs in a regression model.</p>

<p>A PostgreSQL database uses PL/R to call R functions. An R call to calculate Spearman's correlation looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>cor( rank(x), rank(y) )
</code></pre>

<p>Also in R, a naïve calculation of a fitted generalized additive model (GAM):</p>

<pre><code>data.frame( x, fitted( gam( y ~ s(x) ) ) )
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>x</code> represents the years from 1900 to 2009 and <code>y</code> is the average measurement (e.g., minimum temperature) for that year.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>The fitted trend line (using GAM) is reasonably accurate, as you can see in the following picture:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/X0gxV.png"" /></p>

<p>The problem is that the correlations (shown in the bottom left) do not accurately reflect how closely the model fits the data.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution</strong></p>

<p>One way to improve the accuracy of the correlation is to use a root mean square error (RMSE) calculation on binned data.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p><em>Q.1.</em> How would you implement the RMSE calculation on the binned data to get a correlation (between 0 and 1) of GAM's fit to the measurements, in the R language?</p>

<p><em>Q.2.</em> Is there a better way to find the accuracy of GAM's fit to the data, and if so, what is it (e.g., root mean square deviation)?</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solution 1</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Call the PL/R function using the observed amounts and the model (GAM) amounts: <pre><code>correlation_rmse := climate.plr_corr_rmse( v_amount, v_model );</code></pre></li>
<li>Define <code>plr_corr_rmse</code> as follows (where <code>o</code> and <code>m</code> represent the observed and modelled data): <pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION climate.plr_corr_rmse(
o double precision[], m double precision[])
RETURNS double precision AS
$BODY$
sqrt( mean( o - m ) ^ 2 )
$BODY$
LANGUAGE 'plr' VOLATILE STRICT
COST 100;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>o - m</code> is wrong. I'd like to bin both data sets by calculating the <code>mean</code> of every 5 data points (there will be at most 110 data points). For example:</p>

<pre><code>omean &lt;- c( mean(o[1:5]), mean(o[6:10]), ... )
mmean &lt;- c( mean(m[1:5]), mean(m[6:10]), ... )
</code></pre>

<p>Then correct the RMSE calculation as:</p>

<pre><code>sqrt( mean( omean - mmean ) ^ 2 )

<p>How do you calculate <code>c( mean(o[1:5]), mean(o[6:10]), ... )</code> for an arbitrary length vector in an appropriate number of bins (5, for example, might not be ideal for only 67 measurements)?</p>

<p>I don't think <code>hist</code> is suitable here, is it?</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solution 2</strong></p>

<p>The following code will solve the problem, however it drops data points from the end of the list (to make the list divisible by 5). The solution isn't ideal as the number ""5"" is rather magical.</p>

<pre><code>while( length(o) %% 5 != 0 ) {
  o &lt;- o[-length(o)]
}

omean &lt;- apply( matrix(o, 5), 2, mean )
</code></pre>

<p>What other options are available?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>related, but different question is hexbin. When time objects are added to hexbin, the plot from the hexbin does not show correct time format on the units.</p>

It's county level data set broken into segments, sub-segments, and sub-sub-segments (for a total of ~200 factors) for 40 years. In short, it's huge, and it's not going to fit into memory if I try to simply read it.</p>

<p>So my question is this, given that I want all the counties, but only a single year (and just the highest level of segment... leading to about 100,000 rows in the end), what would be the best way to go about getting this rollup into R?</p>

<p>Currently I'm trying to chop out irrelevant years with Python, getting around the filesize limit by reading and operating on one line at a time, but I'd prefer an R-only solution (CRAN packages OK). Is there a similar way to read in files a piece at a time in R?</p>

<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Constraints</li>
<ul>
<li>Needs to use <em>my</em> machine, so no EC2 instances</li>
<li>As R-only as possible. Speed and resources are not concerns in this case... provided my machine doesn't explode...</li>
<li>As you can see below, the data contains mixed types, which I need to operate on later</li></ul>
<li>Data</li>
<ul>
<li>The data is 3.5GB, with about 8.5 million rows and 17 columns</li>
<li>A couple thousand rows (~2k) are malformed, with only one column instead of 17</li>
<ul><li>These are entirely unimportant and can be dropped</li></ul>
<li>I only need ~100,000 rows out of this file (See below)</li></ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>County; State; Year; Quarter; Segment; Sub-Segment; Sub-Sub-Segment; GDP; ...
Ada County;NC;2009;4;FIRE;Financial;Banks;80.1; ...
Ada County;NC;2010;1;FIRE;Financial;Banks;82.5; ...
NC  [Malformed row]
[8.5 Mill rows]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to chop out some columns and pick two out of 40 available years (2009-2010 from 1980-2020), so that the data can fit into R:</p>

<pre><code>County; State; Year; Quarter; Segment; GDP; ...
Ada County;NC;2009;4;FIRE;80.1; ...
Ada County;NC;2010;1;FIRE;82.5; ...
[~200,000 rows]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p>After tinkering with all the suggestions made, I decided that readLines, suggested by JD and Marek, would work best. I gave Marek the check because he gave a sample implementation.</p>

<p>I've reproduced a slightly adapted version of Marek's implementation for my final answer here, using strsplit and cat to keep only columns I want.</p>

<p>It should also be noted this is <em>MUCH</em> less efficient than Python... as in, Python chomps through the 3.5GB file in 5 minutes while R takes about 60... but if all you have is R then this is the ticket.</p>

<pre><code>## Open a connection separately to hold the cursor position
file.in &lt;- file('bad_data.txt', 'rt')
file.out &lt;- file('chopped_data.txt', 'wt')
line &lt;- readLines(file.in, n=1)
line.split &lt;- strsplit(line, ';')
# Stitching together only the columns we want
cat(line.split[[1]][1:5], line.split[[1]][8], sep = ';', file = file.out, fill = TRUE)
## Use a loop to read in the rest of the lines
line &lt;- readLines(file.in, n=1)
while (length(line)) {
  line.split &lt;- strsplit(line, ';')
  if (length(line.split[[1]]) &gt; 1) {
    if (line.split[[1]][3] == '2009') {
        cat(line.split[[1]][1:5], line.split[[1]][8], sep = ';', file = file.out, fill = TRUE)
    }
  }

<p><strong>Failings by Approach:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>sqldf</li>
<ul><li>This is definitely what I'll use for this type of problem in the future if the data is well-formed. However, if it's not, then SQLite chokes.</li></ul>
<li>MapReduce</li>
<ul><li>To be honest, the docs intimidated me on this one a bit, so I didn't get around to trying it. It looked like it required the object to be in memory as well, which would defeat the point if that were the case.</li></ul>
<li>bigmemory</li>
<ul><li>This approach cleanly linked to the data, but it can only handle one type at a time. As a result, all my character vectors dropped when put into a big.table. If I need to design large data sets for the future though, I'd consider only using numbers just to keep this option alive.</li></ul>
<li>scan</li>
<ul><li>Scan seemed to have similar type issues as big memory, but with all the mechanics of readLines. In short, it just didn't fit the bill this time.</li></ul>

<p>I am fitting to the data distribution the sum of two normal with means m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> and standard deviations s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub>. The two gaussians are scaled by a weight factor such that w<sub>1</sub>+w<sub>2</sub> = 1</p>

<p>I can succeed to do this using the <code>vglm</code> function of the <code>VGAM</code> package such as:</p>

<pre><code>    fitRes &lt;- vglm(mydata ~ 1, mix2normal1(equalsd=FALSE), 
          iphi=w, imu=m1, imu2=m2, isd1=s1, isd2=s2))
</code></pre>

<p>This is painfully slow and it can take several minutes depending on the data, but I can live with that.</p>

<p>Now I would like to see how the distribution of my data changes over time, so essentially I break up my data in a few (30-50) blocks and repeat the fit process for each of those.</p>

<p>So, here are the questions:</p>

<p>1) how do I speed up the fit process? I tried to use <code>nls</code> or <code>mle</code> that look much faster but mostly failed to get good fit (but succeeded in getting all the possible errors these function could throw on me). Also is not clear to me how to impose limits with those functions (w in [0;1] and w<sub>1</sub>+w<sub>2</sub>=1)</p>

<p>2) how do I automagically choose some good starting parameters (I know this is a $1 million question but you'll never know, maybe someone has the answer)? Right now I have a little interface that allow me to choose the parameters and visually see what the initial distribution would look like which is very cool, but I would like to do it automatically for this task.</p>

<p>I thought of relying on the x corresponding to the 3rd and 4th quartiles of the y as starting parameters for the two mean? Do you thing that would be a reasonable thing to do? </p>

Ultimately this is going to run through Hadoop streaming so before you ask, I think it really does need to be in a text file. (but I'm open to other ideas) This all seemed seemed pretty straight forward at first. But I can't quite get serialization to work the way I want it (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2258511/r-serialize-objects-to-text-file-and-back-again"">still</a>). </p>

<p>If I do this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; rawToChar(serialize(""blah"", NULL, ascii=T))
[1] ""A\n2\n133888\n131840\n16\n1\n9\n4\nblah\n""
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have those pesky \n which screw up my CSV parsing later. I could go in and replace the \n with some other string, which I'm not opposed to doing. This seems a little messy, however.</p>

<p>The other option that came to mind is omitting the rawToChar() call and pumping the raw ascii into a text file:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; serialize(""blah"", NULL, ascii=T)
 [1] 41 0a 32 0a 31 33 33 38 38 38 0a 31 33 31 38 34 30 0a 31 36 0a 31 0a 39 0a
[26] 34 0a 62 6c 61 68 0a
</code></pre>

<p>Well if I just dump that to a text file I'll get \n after each element in the list. So I tried doing a little paste/collapse:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ser &lt;- serialize(""blah"", NULL, ascii=T)
&gt; ser2 &lt;- paste(ser, collapse="""")
&gt; ser2
[1] ""410a320a3133333838380a3133313834300a31360a310a390a340a626c61680a""
</code></pre>

<p>Now that's a value I can write to a CSV text file! Only... how do I turn that back into raw again later? Let's just take the first hex element: 41 I can't even figure out how to create a list of raw items and shove a hex value 41 into one of the elements. When I try to shove a raw hex value into a raw list I end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; r &lt;- raw(1)
&gt; r[1] &lt;- 41
Error in r[1] &lt;- 41 : 
  incompatible types (from double to raw) in subassignment type fix
&gt; r[1] &lt;- as.raw(41)
&gt; r[1]
[1] 29 
</code></pre>

<p>Crap! 29!=41 (except for really large values of 29 and really small values of 41, of course)</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to crack this nut? </p>

The algorithm used is called <em>iteratively reweighted least squares</em> (IRLS), which is a fairly documented algorithm. For each iteration, there is a call to a Fortran function to solve the weighted least squares problem.</p>

<p>From the end-user's viewpoint, for a logistic regression for instance, a call in R looks just like this:</p>

<pre><code>y &lt;- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
x &lt;- rnorm(100)
glm(y~x, family=binomial)$coefficients

<p>And if you do not want to use a <em>intercept</em>, either of these calls is okay:</p>

<pre><code>glm(y~x-1, family=binomial)$coefficients
glm(y~x+0, family=binomial)$coefficients

<p>However, I cannot manage to understand how the <em>formula</em>, i.e. <code>y~x</code> or <code>y~x-1</code>, is making sense in the code and being understood as for whether to use an intercept or not. I was looking for a part of the code where a column of ones would be bound to <code>x</code>, but it seems there is none.</p>

<p>As far as I have read, the boolean intercept which appears in the function called <code>glm.fit</code> is not the same as the intercept which I am referring to. And it is the same for the <em>offset</em>.</p>

Eventually I want to take the data from each .xml and build a dataframe.  It seems like xmlTreeParse along with xmlToList will help but the latter only works well with a flat structure.  I have played around with unlisting the output from xmlToList and then converting it a dataframe but the output is a bit funky.</p>

<p>However, I am still wondering something.</p>

<p>What is costly in R is not the loop itself right?
I mean, the problem arises when you start modifying variables within the loop for example is that correct?</p>

<p>Hence I was thinking, what if you simply have to run a function on each element (you actually do not care about the result). For example to write data in a database. What should you do?</p>

<p>1) use mapply without storing the result anywhere?</p>

<p>2) do a loop over the vector and only apply f(i) to each element?</p>

<p>3) is there a better function I might have missed?</p>

<p>(that's of course assuming your function is not optimally vectorized).</p>

<p>What about the <code>foreach</code> package? Have you experienced any performance improvement by using it?</p>

<p>It is my understanding that R should be able to have vectors with size up to 2^32-1 elements (or 2^64-1 according the the version).

<p>In the below I have used the example of baseball statistics to illustrate my problem. When I plot the same data with two layers, the same jitter call jitters the geoms a bit differently.
This makes sense because it presumably generates the random jitter independently in the two calls, but yields the problem you can see in my graph below.</p>

<pre><code>p=ggplot(baseball,aes(x=round(year,-1),y=sb,color=factor(lg))) 
p=p+stat_summary(fun.data=""mean_cl_normal"",position=position_jitter(width=3,height=0))+coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,40))

<p>Although the error bar points and the line refer to same data, they are disjointed—the lines and points do not connect.</p>

<p>Is there a work-around for this? I thought position dodge might be the answer but it doesn't seem to work with these kinds of plots. Alternatively, maybe there's some way to get the mean_cl_normal call to also add the lines?

<p>I read in the files, and sum the specific columns -- <code>V10</code>, <code>V15</code> and then observe the values. This way I can ignore very small differences in floating point data per row.</p>

<p>However, going forward, I would like to set a tolerance percent, ie. <code>if abs( (prod.V10 - test.V10)/prod.V10 ) &gt; 0.01%</code>, and only print those row numbers that exceed this tolerance limit.</p>

<p>Also, if the data is not in the sane order, how can I do a comparison by specifying columns that will act like a composite primary key?</p>

<p>For e.g., if I did this in Sybase, I'd have written something like:</p>

<pre><code>select A.*, B.* 
from tableA A, tableB B
where abs( (A.Col15-B.Col15)/A.Col15) ) &gt; 0.01%
  and A.Col1 = B.Col1
  and A.Col4 = B.Col4
  and A.Col6 = B.Col6

<p>If I try doing the same thing using <code>sqldf</code> in <strong>R</strong>, it does NOT work as the files contain <strong>500K+</strong> rows of data.</p>

<p>If I try to run the results of the system call through rjson, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: '\/' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting ""s3n:\/""
</code></pre>

<p>I believe this is because of the double escaping in the s3n line. I'm struggling to get this text massaged into something that will parse. </p>

<p>It might be as simple as replacing ""\\"" with ""\"" but since I kinda struggle with regex and escaping, I can't get that done properly. </p>

<p>So how do I take a vector of strings and replace any occurrence of ""\\"" with ""\""? (even to type this question I had to use three back slashes to represent two) Any other tips related to this specific use case?</p>

<p>Here's my code in more detail:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; library(rjson)
&gt; emrJson &lt;- paste(system(""~/EMR/elastic-mapreduce --describe --jobflow j-2H9P770Z4B8GG"", intern=T))
&gt; 
&gt;     parser &lt;- newJSONParser()
&gt;     for (i in 1:length(emrJson)){
+       parser$addData(emrJson[i])
+     }
&gt; 
&gt; parser$getObject()
Error: '\/' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting ""s3n:\/""

<p>and if you're itching to recreate the emrJson object, here's the dput() output:</p>

<p>After computing a rather large vector (a bit shorter than 2^20 elements), I have to store the result in a database.</p>

<p>The script takes about 4 hours to execute with a simple code such as :</p>

<pre><code>#Do the processing
myVector&lt;-processData(myData)
#Sends every thing to the database
lapply(myVector,sendToDB)
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think is the most efficient way to do this?</p>

<p>I thought about using the same query to insert multiple records (multiple inserts) but it simply comes back to ""chucking"" the data.</p>

<p>Is there any vectorized function do send that into a database?</p>

<p>Interestingly, the code takes a huge amount of time before starting to process the first element of the vector. That is, if I place a <code>browser()</code> call inside <code>sendToDB</code>, it takes 20 minutes before it is reached for the first time (and I mean 20 minutes without taking into account the previous line processing the data). So I was wondering what R was doing during this time?</p>

<p>Is there another way to do such operation in R that I might have missed (parallel processing maybe?)</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>PS: here is a skelleton of the sendToDB function:</p>

<pre><code>sendToDB&lt;-function(id,data) {
  channel&lt;-odbcChannel(...)
  query&lt;-paste(""INSERT INTO history VALUE("",id,"",\"""",data,""\"")"",sep="""")
  sqlQuery(channel,query)
  odbcClose(channel)
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's the idea.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I am at the moment trying out the <code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code> command.</p>

<p>I still have no idea why it takes so long to reach the internal function of the <code>lapply</code> for the first time.</p>

<p><strong><em>SOLUTION</em></strong></p>

<p><code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code> is indeed much quicker. Writing into a file line by line using <code>write</code> is affordable and <code>write.table</code> is even quicker.</p>

<p>The overhead I was experiencing for <code>lapply</code> was coming from the fact that I was looping over <code>POSIXct</code> objects. It is much quicker to use <code>seq(along.with=myVector)</code> and then process the data from within the loop.</p>

<p>And the results are: </p>

<pre><code># littler script

<li>Remove all the links that are internal links (that is If I start from www.website.com.  Then I want to remove all the links from the shape ""www.website.com/***"").  But store all the external links.</li>

<li>Continue until (let's say) X jumps from the first page.</li>
<li>Plot the data collected.</li>

There are dozens or hundreds of possible tags and their usage follows a typical power law:
some tags are used extremely often but most are rare.
All but the most frequent couple dozen tags could typically be ignored, in fact.</p>

<p>Now the problem is how to visualize the relationship between these tags.
A tag cloud is a nice visualization of just their frequencies but it ignores which tags occur with which other tags.
Suppose tag :bar only occurs on objects also tagged :foo.
That should be visually apparent.
Similarly for three tags that tend to occur together.</p>

<p>You could make each tag a bubble and let them partially overlap with each other.
Technically that's a Venn diagram but treating it that way might be unwieldy.
For example, Google charts can create Venn diagrams, but only for 3 or fewer sets (tags):
<a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/venn_charts.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/venn_charts.html</a><br>
The reason they limit it to 3 sets is that any more and it looks horrendous.
See ""extentions to higher numbers of sets"" on the Wikipedia page:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagrams"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagrams</a></p>

<p>But that's only if every possible intersection is non-empty.
If no more than 3 tags ever co-occur (maybe after throwing out the rare tags) then a collection of Venn diagrams could work (with the sizes of the bubbles representing tag frequency).</p>

<p>Or perhaps a graph (as in vertices and edges) with visually thicker or thinner edges to represent frequency of co-occurrence.</p>

<p>Do you have any ideas, or pointers to tools or libraries?
Ideally I'd do this with javascript but I'm open to things like R and Mathematica or really anything else.
I'm happy to share some actual data (you'll laugh if I tell you what it represents) if anyone is curious.</p>

<p>I have a number of data files that are temperature against a time series. I am importing the CSV as a ZOO object then converting to XTS. A correct file looks like this, with readings on the hour and the half hour:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;head(master1)
                       S_1
2010-03-03 00:00:00 2.8520

2010-03-03 01:00:00 2.5685
2010-03-03 01:30:00 2.3800
2010-03-03 02:00:00 2.2225
2010-03-03 02:30:00 2.0650
</code></pre>

<p>But the time value on some are slightly out - i.e. 23:59:00 not 00:00:00, or 00:29:00 instead of 00:30:00.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;head(master21)
                       S_21
2010-03-04 23:59:00  -0.593
2010-03-05 00:29:00  -0.908
2010-03-05 00:59:00  -1.034
2010-03-05 01:29:00  -1.223
2010-03-05 01:59:00  -1.349
2010-03-05 02:29:00  -1.538
</code></pre>

<p>I want to correct these time series, as the minute difference is not important for my analysis and I ultimately want to merge the files, so each timeseries needs to have the same timing.</p>

<p>I want a command that can just say ""shift the time series forward by 1 minute, but don't alter the data column (e.g. S_21).
I have had some luck with <code>gsub()</code> on easier changes, and contemplated a complex regex to change the data before it is converted to ZOO or XTS. I have read about <code>lag()</code> and <code>diff()</code> but they seem to move the data values relative to the time series; please correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>Any help solving this issue would be much appreciated.</p>

I'm new to R.</p>

<p>I have two panel data files, with columns ""id"", ""date"" and ""ret""</p>

<p>file A has a lot more data than file B,
but i'm primarily working with file B data.</p>

<p>Combination of ""id"" and ""date"" is unqiue indentifier. </p>

<p>Is there an elegent way of looking up for each (id, date) in B, I need to get the past 10 days ret from file A, and store them back into B?</p>

<p>my naive way of doing it is to loop for all rows in B,</p>

<pre><code>for i in 1:length(B) {
    B$past10d[i] &lt;- prod(1+A$ret[which(A$id == B$id[i] &amp; A$date &gt; B$date[i]-10 &amp; A$date &lt; B$date[i])])-1
}
</code></pre>

<p>but the loops takes forever. </p>

<p>Really appreciate your thoughts.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>I am using the following code in R to try and plot the data to get the share price on the Y axis and the timestamp on the x axis:</p>

<pre><code>library (XML)

<p>However the resulting plot is not what I expect. It returns the Time stamps on the x axis but the y axis is numbered from 1 - 7. Is there something I should be doing to alter the data set either in R or the XML file itself?</p>

<p>Input data being binary, I use Python to read data out and pass them to R, then collect results to output.</p>

<p>Data are organized into pieces, each being around 100 Bytes (1Byte per value * 100 values).</p>

<p>They just work now, but the speed is very low. Here are some of my test on 1GB size (that is, 10^7 pieces) of data:</p>

<p>If I disable Rpy2 calls to make a dry run, it takes about 90min for Python to loop all through on a Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.06GHz using one single thread.</p>

<p>If I enable full functionality and multithreading on that Xeon dual core, it (will by estimation) take ~200hrs for the program to finish.</p>

<p>I killed the Python program several times the call stack is almost alwarys pointing to Rpy2 function interface. I also did profiling, which gives similar results.</p>

<p>All these observations indicates the R part called by Rpy2 is the bottleneck. So I profiled a standalone version of my R program, but the profiling summary points to ""Anonymous"". I am still pushing my way to see which part of my R script is the most time consuming one. ****updated, see my edit below*****</p>

<p>There are two suspicious candidates through, one being a continuous wavelets transformation (CWT) and wavelets transformation modulus maxima (WTMM) using wmtsa from cran[1], the other being a non-linear fitting of ex-gaussion curve.</p>

<p>What come to my mind are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>for fitting, I could substitute R routing with inline C code? there are many fitting library available in C and fortran... (idea from the net; I never did that; unsure)</p></li>
<li><p>for wavelet algorithms.... I would have to analyze the wmtsa package to rewrite hotspots in C? .... reimplementing the entire wmtsa package using C or fortran would be very non-trivial for me. I have not much programming experience.</p></li>
<li><p>the data piece in file is organized in 20 consecutive Bytes, which I could map directly to a C-like char* array? at present my Python program just read one Byte at a time and append it to a list, which is slow. This part of code takes 1.5 hrs vs. ~200 hrs for R, so not that urgent.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is the first time I meet program efficiency in solving real problems . I STFW and felt overwhelmed by the informations. Please give me some advice for what to do next and how. </p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<li><a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wmtsa/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wmtsa/index.html</a></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>* Update *</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to proftools from cran, I managed to create a call stack graph. And I could see that ~56% of the time are spent on wmtsa, code snippet is like:</p>

<pre><code>W &lt;- wavCWT(s,wavelet=""gaussian1"",variance=1/p) # 1/4
W.tree &lt;-wavCWTTree(W) # 1/2
holderSpectrum(W.tree) # 1/4
</code></pre>

<p>~28% of time is spent on nls:</p>

<pre><code>nls(y ~ Q * dexGAUS(x, m, abs(s), abs(n)) + B, start = list(Q = 1000, m = h$time[i], s = 3, n = 8, B = 0), algorithm=""default"", trace=FALSE)
</code></pre>

<p>where evaluation of dexGAUS from gamlss.dist package takes the majority of time.</p>

<p>remaining ~10% of R time are spent on data passing/split/aggregation/subset.</p>

    rmantel = ""mantel.rtest""
and substituting that 
    result = robjects.r.rmantel (M1, M2, nrepet = 9999)
only to receive the error: <strong>""AttributeError: 'R' object has no attribute 'rmantel'""</strong> - so that did not work. Any thoughts as to how I can get around this issue?""</em></p>

<p>I would like to create an interactive graph that would allow a user to click on a point and get information on the the value of the point (eg if the value jumped a reason so), I would like to be able to put this interactive graph on a web page. It has been suggested to use GGOBI to do this, while others say it is possible to remain in R and use the rggobi library. As I have no experience of this I thought I'd ask for some pointers either directly or to a specific resource (one can spend years searching the net and not find anything)</p>

<p>Under the graph I would like to print out the summary of the  Price. At the moment I run the code in a BATCH file on windows and it returns the graphs in a pdf file but not the summary print. Is there a way to set up the code / BATCH file so that it can produce the interactive graph and summary?</p>

<p>I am trying to write a simulation that will compare a number of statistical procedures on different subsets of rows (subjects) and columns (variables) of a large matrix.</p>

<p>Subsets of rows was fairly easy using a <code>sample()</code> of the subject ID numbers, but I am running into a little more trouble with columns.</p>

<p>Essentially, what I'd like to be able to do is create a random sample of column index numbers which will then be used to create a new matrix. What's got me the closest so far is:</p>

<p>which gives me a string that has a <code>testmat[,column.ind]</code> for every sampled index number. Is there any way to easily plug that into a <code>cbind()</code> function to make a new matrix? Is there any other obvious way I'm missing?</p>

<p>I've been able to do it using a loop (i.e. <code>cbind(matrix,newcolumn)</code> over and over), but that's fairly slow as the matrix I'm using is quite large and I will be doing this many times. I'm hoping there's a couple-line solution that's more elegant and quicker.</p>

I guess StatET / Eclipse appears to be the ""standard"" solution for Sweavers. </p>

<p>1) Is it reasonable to switch from Komodo to StatET Eclipse? I tried StatET before but chose Komodo over StatET because I liked the calltip / autosuggest and the more convenient config from Komodo so much. </p>

<p>2) What´s a reasonable workflow to generate Sweave files? Usually I develop my R code first and then care about the report later. I just learned today that there is one file in Sweave that contains R code and Latex code at once and that from this file the .tex document is created. While the example files look handily and can't really imagine how to enter my 250 + lines of R code to a file and mixed it up with Latex.</p>

<p>Is it possible to just enter the qplot() and ggplot() statements to a such a document and source the functionality like database connection and intermediate results somehow?</p>

<p>Or is it just a matter of being used to the mix of Latex and R code?</p>

<p>Thx to suggestions from the mailing list I realized that the problem I got has nothing to do with Sweave or Latex. It´s some Mac OS X related issue. Whenever I run my script by selecting all and sending it to R it works.</p>

<p>When I use</p>

<p>i get the error message stated below</p>

<p>finally I got sweave working together with ggplot2 on my Mac OS X. I invoke Sweave inside R with </p>

<pre><code>Sweave(""myfile.Rnw"")
</code></pre>

<p>which creates the desired latex output. Now that the basic tests work, I try to source my real world file and it crashes at the following line: </p>

<pre><code> gl_bybranch = ddply(new_wans,.(period,Branchen),
 function(X)data.frame(Geschäftslage=mean(X$sentiment)))
</code></pre>

<p>I guess it has either to do with the "".(period...)"" or the ""ä"" . Unfortunately I can't change these labels because they are also used in legends. So, somewhere in my code these ugly umlauts will appear. Is there a way to escape them in Sweave? I can't believe that this is problem since Sweave is written by a German who probably have second most umlaut characters (behind Turkey). </p>

<p>The error message I get is: invalid multibyte character in Parser on line 195</p>

<p><strong>[[EDIT]]</strong>
It's been a few months since I had this problem. I had initially solved this by editing my Java paths, as illustrated in the answer I posted below. I recently ran into the same issue on a new Ubuntu install. I tried Dirk's recommendation to use apt-get to install the rJava package. It worked perfectly. What I failed to appreciate initially is that installing packages using the Ubuntu apt-get method is fundamentally different than just loading the same package using install.packages() inside of R. The Ubuntu packages solve some issues which I didn't realize or appreciate. </p>

How can I get any help buffer to open in a separate window like the usual emacs and R interaction, and how can I get rid of the double-prompts when I execute the shell?</p>

Arithmetic Mean

Description:

 Generic function for the (trimmed) arithmetic mean.

Usage:

 mean(x, ...)

 ## Default S3 method:
 mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)

Arguments:

   x: An R object.  Currently there are methods for numeric/logical
      vectors and date, date-time and time interval objects, and
      for data frames all of whose columns have a method.  Complex
      vectors are allowed for 'trim = 0', only.

trim: the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trimmed from
</code></pre>

<p>[24;1H[K:[24;1H[24;1H[K          each end of 'x' before the mean is computed.  Values of trim
[24;1H[K: 
[24;1H[24;1H[K          outside that range are taken as the nearest endpoint.</p>

<pre><code>na.rm: a logical value indicating whether 'NA' values should be
      stripped before the computation proceeds.

 ...: further arguments passed to or from other methods.

Value:

 For a data frame, a named vector with the appropriate method being
 applied column by column.

 If 'trim' is zero (the default), the arithmetic mean of the values
 in 'x' is computed, as a numeric or complex vector of length one.
 If 'x' is not logical (coerced to numeric), numeric (including
 integer) or complex, 'NA_real_' is returned, with a warning.

 If 'trim' is non-zero, a symmetrically trimmed mean is computed
 with a fraction of 'trim' observations deleted from each end
 before the mean is computed.

<p>Update for some context: </p>

<p>Hi Cipi and SiggyF.</p>

<p>I understand your concerns about this being homework, so in case you read this again, here's some context that I hope may dispell your doubts. </p>

<p>I am working with time-series cross sectional data in which N is much larger than T. I would like to use panel-corrected standard errors like those proposed in Beck &amp; Katz (1995). The packages ""pcse"" is mostly able to do this just fine. When you have an unbalanced panel, it essentially creates a ""rectangular"" dataset (every time units has the full amount of observations) by filling in missing values for the omitted observations in every panel. Then, pcse computes a matrix Sigma.hat which is essentially the weighted average of the outer product of the residuals within time periods (think of it as averaging over an N X N X T array to bring it down to a N X N Sigma.hat). </p>

<p>The problem is that if any two units have zero contemporaneous observation, then the corresponding cell in Sigma.hat will be NA, and pcse won't be able to use it to get the sandwich estimator of the variance covariance matrix. In my example, the data frame numbers correspond to the index of the missing values in Sigma.hat. I want to trim down Sigma.hat automatically, to get an estimate of the VCOV that uses the most information possible, hence my desire to keep as many of the numbers in the data frame. </p>

<p>This is probably very unclear to anyone who hasn't looked into pcse, but I hope you get the gist of it. </p>

<p>Sorry to have given an impression of impropriety, but I assure you, this is legit.  </p>

Regular expressions, on the other hand, remain <em>terra incognita</em> and the most hated part in my programming life so far ... Recently, I've officially started JavaScript recapitulation, and I'm trying to create precise RegExp to check correct R object name.</p>

<p><strong><em>Brief intro:</em></strong> 
Object names must start with <code>.</code> or lower/uppercase letter, and if they start with <code>.</code> cannot continue with numeric... afterward, alphanumeric symbols are allowed with <code>.</code> and underscore <code>_</code>.</p>

<p>Long story short, here's my JS code:</p>

<pre><code>var txt = ""._."";
var inc = /^\.(?!\d)|^[a-z\.]/i;

document.write(inc.test(txt));
</code></pre>

<p>This approach manages the first part (<code>.</code> and/or lower/upper case and numeric after <code>.</code>), but I cannot pass something like <code>&amp; [\w\.]</code>. I can write a function that will take care of this one, but is it at all possible to manage this with a single RegExp?</p>

This works well, but I want to log the data and change the plot's axes to a log-scaled version of the original data (this is easily done using the 'plot' function's built in 'log' argument to alter the plot axes - log=""xy""). The problem is, the plotting of the CIs and regression line is based on the scale of the (logged) data, which in this case would range between the values of about 0 to 2, while the plot's axes would range from about 0 to 200. Thus the CIs and regression line would not be visible on the plot.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find a way to alter the CIs and regression line to fit the logged plot, or to alter the plot axes manually to mimic using log=""xy"".</p>

I want to save these files and then call on the R program to compare them:</p>

<pre><code># windownA and windownB are lists containing ascending sequences of integers

z = 0

    file = csv.writer(open(filename, 'w'))
    file.writerow(M1)

<p>Basically, I have two vectors of data (let's call it experimental and baseline).

<p>Each row should be a new pair of histograms. Columns 1-9 represents the data for the experiment (left-side histogram). Columns 10-18 represents the baseline data (right-side histogram).</p>

<p>Can anyone help me on this? Thanks.</p>

<p>it does so(when I call the names in the dataframe, they are included), but then I can no longer view the dataframe.  R says to me:</p>

<p>How can I solve this so that I can view the data frame before I run the analysis?  I want to look at it, since it looks like I will have to use glm instead of plm (pooling)  for this analysis since the dependent variable is a binary variable and plm does not support these d.v.'s</p>

<p>I was wondering if I can supply the boot:boot() function a function that has as its output a vector of length n > 1? Is it at all possible?</p>

<p>I don't really understand why <code>Hmisc::cut2()</code> isn't working properly in the <code>boot()</code> call, but works when I call it in a <code>for()</code> loop (see code above). Is the logic of my <code>bootstrapDistances()</code> function feasible with <code>boot()</code>? Any pointers much appreciated.</p>

<p><em>.:EDIT:.</em></p>

<p>Aniko suggested I modify my function in such a way, to include an index. While reading the documentation for boot(), this wasn't clear to me how it works, which explains why the function may not be working. Here's the new function Aniko suggested:</p>

<pre><code>bootstrapDistances2 &lt;- function(data, idx, binx) { 
  data.cut &lt;- cut2(x = data[idx], cuts = binx) 
  data.cut &lt;- table(data.cut)/sum(table(data.cut))

<p>However, I managed to produce an error and I'm still working how to remove it.</p>

<p>Here is the Perl script I have written thus far. I have successfully read each line into the appropriate array. I have the general flow of what I need for the final print function, but I need to figure out how to ONLY print the appropriate @levels and @labels arrays for each @vars array.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

#Need to change to read from argument in command line
open(VARVAL, ""append.txt"");
@lines = &lt;VARVAL&gt;;
close(VARVAL);

#Read through each line and put into a variable, a value, or a reject
#I really only want to read in everything between ""value labels"" and ""execute .""
#That probably requires more regex...
foreach  (@lines){
    if ($_ =~ /\//){        #Anything with a / is a variable, remove the / and push
        $_ =~ tr/\///d;
        push(@vars, $_)
    } elsif ($_ =~/\d/) {
        push(@vals, $_)    #Anything that has a number in the line is a value
        }
}
#Splitting each @vals array into levels or labels arrays
foreach (@vals){
    @values = split(/\s+/, $_); #Splitting on a space, vunerable...better to split on first non digit character?
    foreach (@values) {
        if ($_ =~/\d/){
            push(@levels, $_);
        } else {
            push(@labels, $_)
        }
    }
}

#Get rid of newline
#I should provavly do this somewhere else?
chomp(@vars);
chomp(@levels);
chomp(@labels);

#Need to tell it when to stop adding in @levels &amp; @labels. While loop? Hash lookup?
#Need to get rid of final comma
#Need to redirect output to a file
foreach (@vars){
    print $_ ."" &lt;- as.factor("" . $_ . ""\n\t, levels = c("" ;
         foreach (@levels){
            print $_ . "","";
         }
    print "")\n\t, labels = c("";
    foreach(@labels){
            print $_ . "","";
        }
    print "")\n\t)\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, here is sample output from the script as it currently runs:</p>

<pre><code>gender &lt;- as.factor(gender
    , levels = c(1,2,1,2,3,)
    , labels = c(""M"",""F"",""biz"",""action"",""tiddlywinks"",)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>I need this to only include levels 1,2 and labels M and F.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

The major thing that is holding me back is my need to easily generate tables, banners, and cross-tabs for the market research that I do.  I love the Custom Tables option in SPSS and am looking for advice on how to replicate it with R.</p>

<p>I believe R has a ton of advantages over SPSS, one of which is the ability to integrate with LaTeX for reproducible reports.  SPSS is great for quick exploration (point and click), but leaves alot to be desired when taking the results and packaging it to an acceptable deliverable for clients, etc. That said, R is so powerful, I feel like I could do everything I need in it if I could only do my banners/crosstabs the way I need them.</p>

<p>In short, what are my options to generate report-worthy tables similar to what I have below? I am copying the SPSS syntax command and the output for reference.</p>

<pre><code>CTABLES 
  /VLABELS VARIABLES=age educ paeduc maeduc speduc prestg80 happy 
    DISPLAY=DEFAULT 
  /TABLE age [MEAN F40.3, VALIDN COMMA40.0] + educ [MEAN F40.3, VALIDN COMMA40.0] + paeduc [MEAN F40.3, VALIDN COMMA40.0] + maeduc [MEAN F40.3, VALIDN COMMA40.0] + speduc [MEAN F40.3, VALIDN COMMA40.0] + prestg80 [MEAN F40.3, VALIDN COMMA40.0] BY happy

  /COMPARETEST TYPE=PROP ALPHA=0.05 ADJUST=BONFERRONI ORIGIN=COLUMN INCLUDEMRSETS=YES CATEGORIES=ALLVISIBLE MERGE=NO.
</code></pre>

<p>I attached a picture of what the output looks like.  I am particuarly interested in the ability to have multiple variables in the rows/columns and like the flexibility to nest them if I need to.  In the image, I have a few continuous variables cut by a categorical variable in the column with the summary statistics placed in the rows. As an aside, I also really like the feature of quick column mean comparisons -- but figure in can quickly access them in R for conditional crosstab generation.</p>

<li><p>Is this the best approach? Keep in mind that the goals are a) a ggplot2 graph and b) a table with the time series, to be viewed outside of R</p></li>
<li><p>What is the best way to get a list of objects starting with a list of the names of those objects?</p></li>
<li><p>What the best type of graph to highlight the patterns of 60 timeseries? The scale is the same, but I predict there'll be a lot of overplotting. Since this is a cohort analysis, it might be useful to use color to highlight the different cohorts in terms of recency (as a continuous variable). But how to avoid overplotting? The differences will be minimal so faceting might leave the viewer unable to grasp the difference.</p></li>
</ul>

<li>my data is too big for R to handle 30000x30000.</li>

<p>Stackoverflow, </p>

<p>Could you recommend a pathway for learning R in a manner that provides one with a toolset at their disposal to solve problems of a statistical nature?</p>

<p>There's a wealth of knowledge on the internet, between the r-project website and the mailings lists but it seems to be ""everywhere"" and nowhere when you're actually looking for it.</p>

<p>For example, when I first started using R, I went through ""Intro to R"". Then I read the language definition (which obviously hasn't sunk in). But every time I ask a question on Stackoverflow I'm presented with some new badass function that is the solution to all my problems in the short term. My question is, how did you know these functions existed in the first place? And how does one go about finding them? Presumably, you read something or found some resources that detoured your learning to the exponential part of the curve. What was it? </p>

<p>Obviously, R's functionality as a statistical tool is broad. For my own purposes I work mostly with economic or financial data. Hence, answers with this in mind would be most helpful. </p>

The following code does so, but creates a legend for size, which is useless since size has no variable that can be mapped to it.</p>

<p>My plot consists of two lines representing a time series of two different variables over the same time span. The variable is mapped to color. If I try to influence the size of the line, qplot always tries to map ""size"" to another parameter and display another legend. </p>

<p>I also followed <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/browse_thread/thread/28eaca9ea56ce5cc/80faa8947fa6a01a?#80faa8947fa6a01a"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> discussion, that ended with Hadley telling the others that removing a part of the legend is not implemented yet.
I understand that adding another paramater to the mix implies the need of a legend for this parameter. Maybe I am using the wrong command to influence line size just for visual reasons. </p>

Everything works like a charm, it's noticeably faster than Ubuntu, IMHO it's easier to customise, but when it is to do with support for R, well, Ubuntu takes a medal. I'm not willing to do another distro-shuffle and switch back to Ubuntu, while Debian is just ""too stable"" for my taste... so I'll stick with Arch for now. </p>

<p>Bunch of R packages available from Ubuntu's universe and/or multiverse repos (like r-cran-* and revolution-r) are not available in Arch. Of course, you can always install packages within R with <code>install.packages</code>, but there are dozens of Debian/Ubuntu R packages, and excuse me for saying this, but it's painstaking job to track them down. <code>r-cran-lattice</code> can be replaced with <code>install.packages(""lattice"")</code>, but what about <code>revolution-r</code> (<code>revolution-mkl</code>)? I'd like to have RA optimizations in Arch. </p>

<p>Could you, please, give me some advice about this one? What's the catch? <code>r-core</code>, <code>r-base-dev</code>, <code>r-base-core-dbg</code>, <code>r-base-core-ra</code>... Actually, I have two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the difference between these (<code>r-base-*</code>)
packages and ""standard"" R
installation?</li>
<li>And how can I port Debian/Ubuntu packages to Arch (I'm
talking only about those packages
that don't come bundled with an official installation, like <code>r-cran-*</code> and Revolution-R-like packages)?</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be nice if <em>Arch</em>-ers could have out-of-the-box support for R, like Debian, Ubuntu, Suse and Fedora users. I know it's manageable, I just want to know how hard it is.</p>

time &lt;- factor (rep (c(0, 12, 24, 72), c(6, 6, 6, 6)))
</code></pre>

<p>The scale of these data is arbitrary, and in fact I'm going to normalize it so that the average of t=0 is 1.</p>

<pre><code>norm &lt;- values / mean (values[time == 0])
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. Using <code>ggplot</code>, I plot both the individual points, as well as a line that goes through the average at each time point:</p>

<pre><code>require (ggplot2)
p &lt;- ggplot(data = data.frame(time, norm), mapping = aes (x = time, y = norm)) +
    stat_summary (fun.y = mean, geom=""line"", mapping = aes (group = 1)) +
    geom_point()
</code></pre>

<p>However, now I want to apply a logarithmic scale, and this is where my trouble starts. When I do:</p>

<pre><code>q &lt;- ggplot(data = data.frame(time, norm), mapping = aes (x = time, y = norm)) +
    stat_summary (fun.y = mean, geom=""line"", mapping = aes (group = 1)) +
    geom_point() + 
    scale_y_log2()
</code></pre>

<p>The line does NOT go through 0 at t=0, as you would expect because log (1) == 0. Instead the line crosses the y-axis slightly below 0. Apparently, <code>ggplot</code> applies the mean <em>after</em> log transformation, which gives a different result. I want it to take the mean <em>before</em> log transformation.</p>

<p>How can I tell <code>ggplot</code> to apply the mean first? Is there a better way to create this chart?</p>

func2 &lt;- function(y) {
    func1(y)
}

library(doSMP)
wrk &lt;- startWorkers(workerCount = 4) #I have 4 cores, so adjust to your specs
registerDoSMP(wrk)

obj.result &lt;- foreach(i = 1:10000) %dopar% func2(i)
</code></pre>
<p>The above routine doesn't work, but if I nest <code>func1</code> within <code>func2</code> like so</p>
<pre><code>func2 &lt;- function(y) {
func1 &lt;- function(x) {sqrt(x)}
    func1(y)
}
</code></pre>
<p>the process goes through smoothly (as far as I can tell).</p>
<p>How can I call functions from outside with <code>%dopar%</code>?</p>

The data is then processed and some results are sent back to the database.  The problem is that the server closes the connection after about a minute due to inactivity, which is the time needed to process the data locally. Its a shared server, so the host won't bump up the timeout time.</p>

<p>I think there are two possibilities to get around this
1) Open a connection before every database transaction and close it immediately after
2) Send some small 'ping' command to the server every 30 seconds or so to let the server know that I'm still there.</p>

<p>I can implement the first fairly easily, but it seems pretty slow to constantly open and close connections. Anyone know an efficient command for the second? Or a better way altogether?</p>

It's just a hack, as this feature seems to be on the ggplot2 feature to-do list. I do some small calculations to find the number of pages I'm going to need, the number of rows of my <code>data.frame</code> that I need per page etc. I'm pretty confident this all works. </p>

<p>My problem is that, by wrapping it all up in a for loop like this, in between the <code>pdf()</code> and <code>dev.off()</code> functions, is that the for loop doesn't seem to wait for ggplot to do its thing, and blazes through its loop very quickly and outputs an invalid PDF. </p>

<p>If I set <code>i = 1</code>, start the <code>pdf()</code>, run the above code inside the for loop, then set <code>i=2</code>, then run the code, and so on until I get bored (<code>i=3</code>) then turn off the device the resulting PDF is brilliant. </p>

<p>Is there a way I can get the for loop to wait for the final line to finish plotting before moving onto the next iteration?</p>

<p>What I'd like to have is a data frame from the named vector from the <strong>pitch</strong> category, along with the proper (<strong>top</strong>, <strong>atbat</strong>, <strong>bottom</strong>). Therefore, I would need to ignore levels that won't fit into a data.frame due to different number of columns. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>   first second third    des     x
1    top  atbat pitch   Ball 70.29
2    top  atbat pitch Strike 69.24
3 bottom  atbat pitch    Out 67.22
</code></pre>

<p>Is there an elegant way of doing this? Thanks!</p>

<p>The code is doing what I need, but in a very slow way (I have around 7000 data points total for all wards (i.e. max(loop.control.chart) = 7000), and 4 rules to do the scanning, it took me 10 minutes to finished one round.</p>

<p>I can't think of anyway of optimizing it (I thought of tapply, but don't know how to implement it), any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>(And one more trivial question, is the code here readable to you?)</p>

<p>I Have been playing around with a single file and I still get the same problem. I did notice that when supposedly when you mark 'header=""TRUE"" the header needs to have <strong>one column less</strong> then the data. I thought this would help in that the first column would be considered the index, but instead the data frame has it marked in my first category i.e. the last value in the line doesn't have a column name. </p>

<p>I would like to create a table formatted for LaTeX output that contains both the counts and percentages for each column or variable. I have not found a ready made solution to this problem, but feel I must be recreating the wheel to some extent. </p>

<p>I have developed a solution for straight tabulations, but am struggling with adopting something for a cross tabulation.</p>

<p>First some sample data:</p>

<pre><code>#Generate sample data
dow &lt;- sample(1:7, 100, replace=TRUE)
purp &lt;- sample(1:4, 100, replace=TRUE)
dow &lt;- factor(dow, 1:7, c(""Mon"", ""Tues"", ""Wed"", ""Thurs"", ""Fri"", ""Sat"", ""Sun""))
purp &lt;- factor(purp, 1:4, c(""Business"", ""Commute"", ""Vacation"", ""Other""))
</code></pre>

<p>And now the working straight tab function:</p>

<pre><code>customTable &lt;- function(var, capt = NULL){
    counts &lt;- table(var)
    percs &lt;- 100 * prop.table(counts)       

    print(
        xtable(
            cbind(
                Count = counts
                , Percent = percs
            )
        , caption = capt
        , digits = c(0,0,2)
        )
    , caption.placement=""top""
    )
}

#Usage
customTable(dow, capt=""Day of Week"")
customTable(purp, capt=""Trip Pupose"")
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for adopting this for cross tabulations (i.e. day of week BY trip purpose)? Here is what I've currently written, which does NOT use the xtable library and ALMOST works, but is not dynamic and is quite ugly to work with:</p>

<pre><code>#Create table and percentages
a &lt;- table(dow, purp)
b &lt;- round(prop.table(a, 1),2)

#Column bind all of the counts &amp; percentages together, this SHOULD become dynamic in future
d &lt;- cbind( cbind(Count = a[,1],Percent =  b[,1])
        , cbind(Count = a[,2], Percent = b[,2])
        , cbind(Count = a[,3], Percent = b[,3])
        , cbind(Count = a[,4], Percent = b[,4])
)

#Ugly function that needs help, or scrapped for something else

    cat(""\\begin{table}[ht]\n"")
    cat(""\\begin{center}\n"")

Sometimes it's used when a simpler function would have sufficed (e.g., <code>apply</code>),
other times, it's impossible to know exactly what it's is doing without
spending a fair amount of time to step through the code block it's in.</p>

<p>The fact that I can reproduce <code>sweep</code>'s effect using a simpler function suggests that
i don't understand <code>sweep</code>'s core use cases, and the fact that this function is used so often suggests that it's quite useful.</p>

<p>The context:</p>

<p><code>sweep</code> is a function in R's standard library; its arguments are:</p>

<pre><code>sweep(x, MARGIN, STATS, FUN=""-"", check.margin=T, ...)

# x is the data
# STATS refers to the summary statistics which you wish to 'sweep out'
# FUN is the function used to carry out the sweep, ""-"" is the default
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the arguments are similar to <code>apply</code> though <code>sweep</code> requires
one more parameter, <code>STATS</code>.</p>

<p>Another key difference is that <code>sweep</code> returns an array of the <em>same shape</em> as the input array, whereas the result returned by <code>apply</code> depends on the function passed in.</p>

<p><code>sweep</code> in action:</p>

<pre><code># e.g., use 'sweep' to express a given matrix in terms of distance from 
# the respective column mean

# create some data:
M = matrix( 1:12, ncol=3)

# calculate column-wise mean for M
dx = colMeans(M)

# now 'sweep' that summary statistic from M
sweep(M, 2, dx, FUN=""-"")

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] -1.5 -1.5 -1.5
[2,] -0.5 -0.5 -0.5
[3,]  0.5  0.5  0.5
[4,]  1.5  1.5  1.5
</code></pre>

<p>So in sum, what i'm looking for is an exemplary use case or two for <code>sweep</code>.</p>

<p>Please, do not recite or link to the R Documentation, mailing lists, or any of the 'primary' R sources--assume I've read them. What I'm interested in is how experienced R programmers/analysts use <code>sweep</code> in their own code.</p>

<p>Faceting is done by </p>

<pre><code>pl &lt;- pl + facet_wrap(~sci_name,ncol=1,scale=""free"")
</code></pre>

<p>The Problem: Numbers on the y-scale don't look good, especially the scales that go from 0-70 (numbers overlapping).
I'd like the somehow change the number of breaks on the y-scale (to let's say just 1 or 2 breaks). Does anybody maybe have an idea how to do that? Any help would be very much appreciated. :)</p>

<p>PS: I didn't include a minimal example because I think it wouldn't help much to solve that specific problem.</p>

<p>Edit after Kohskes answer:</p>

<p>Hi Kohske,
Wow, that was a really fast answer, thanks! However, I think it doesn't work well with facetted plots. Look at</p>

<pre><code>p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))
p &lt;- p + geom_point()
p &lt;- p + facet_wrap(~gear,ncol=1,scale=""free"")
</code></pre>

<p>On the y-scale, it gives 3 breaks in the middle plot and 8 breaks in the lower plot… not very consistent (but at least not overlapping as in my example).</p>

<pre><code>p2 &lt;- p + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(15,30),minor_breaks=c(10,20,25))
</code></pre>

<p>isn't really good neither: two major ticks on lower plots, only one in middle and upper plot.
When having scales with bigger differences than in mtcars, the result would be even less satisfying. Any other ideas? ;)</p>

<p>Edit after Kohskes edit:</p>

<p>Hi, I can't see how to implement this. Searching for ggplot and input_break on google yielded only 10 results, none of them did help. 
I tried </p>

<pre><code>p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))
p &lt;- p + geom_point()
p &lt;- p + facet_wrap(~gear,ncol=1,scale=""free"")
p$input_breaks&lt;-function(., range) {
    pretty(range, n=3)
}
print(p)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't see any effects in the graph (tried for n=1, 3, 15). Could you describe how to implement this on the mtcars example? Thanks!</p>

One one hand it's the typical geek impulse to have the latest version :-) On the other, updates can break functionality and, as an R beginner, I don't want to waste time looking into package incompatibilities and reinstalling libraries, it's almost certain I wouldn't notice any difference with an improved package.</p>

<p>With other applications I have a sense developed from experience on how often to upgrade, how much to wait between the release of an upgrade and installing it and so on. But I'm in the dark with regards to R.</p>

<p>So, using this example (from Hadley's <a href=""http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/book/toolbox.r"" rel=""noreferrer"">website</a>):</p>
<pre><code>(unemp &lt;- qplot(date, unemploy, data=economics, geom=&quot;line&quot;,

yr &lt;- range(economics$unemploy)
unemp + geom_rect(

</code></pre>
<p>I can do this with my data:</p>
<pre><code>dists.med.areaplot + geom_rect(
      aes(NULL, NULL, xmin = phase_start, xmax = phase_end, fill = fPhase), 
      ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, data = phase_starts) + 
      scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c(&quot;#cccccc&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;), 0.2)

<p>which adds Light and Dark categories to the legend and changes ALL the colours to grey.</p>
<p>If I leave out the <code>scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c(&quot;#cccccc&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;), 0.2)</code>, I get the rectangles I expect still with the legend change, but they are completely opaque, on top of my original graph, and use the 1st 2 colours in my colour sequence.</p>

<p>For example, the following code will populate a hash with up to 10000 key/value pairs, where the keys are random letters and the values are random integers. Then, it does 10000 random lookups in that hash.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

my @letters = ('a'..'z');

print @letters . ""\n"";
my %testHash;

for(my $i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++) {
    my $r1 = int(rand(26));
    my $r2 = int(rand(26));
    my $r3 = int(rand(26));
    my $key = $letters[$r1] . $letters[$r2] . $letters[$r3];
    my $value = int(rand(1000));
    $testHash{$key} = $value;
}

my @keyArray = keys(%testHash);
my $keyLen = scalar @keyArray;

for(my $j = 0; $j &lt; 10000; $j++) {
    my $key = $keyArray[int(rand($keyLen))];
    my $lookupValue = $testHash{$key};
    print ""key "" .  $key . "" Lookup $lookupValue \n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that increasingly, I am wanting to have a hash-like data structure in R. The following is the equivalent R code:</p>

<pre><code>testHash &lt;- list()

for(i in 1:10000) {
  key.tmp = paste(letters[floor(26*runif(3))], sep="""")
  key &lt;- capture.output(cat(key.tmp, sep=""""))
  value &lt;- floor(1000*runif(1))
  testHash[[key]] &lt;- value
}

keyArray &lt;- attributes(testHash)$names
keyLen = length(keyArray);

for(j in 1:10000) {
  key &lt;- keyArray[floor(keyLen*runif(1))]
  lookupValue = testHash[[key]]
  print(paste(""key"", key, ""Lookup"", lookupValue))
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code seem to be doing equivalent things. However, the Perl one is much faster:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;time ./perlHashTest.pl
real    0m4.346s
user    **0m0.110s**
sys 0m0.100s
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing to R:</p>

<pre><code>time R CMD BATCH RHashTest.R

real    0m8.210s
user    **0m7.630s**
sys 0m0.200s
</code></pre>

<p>What explains the discrepancy? Are lookups in R lists just not good?</p>

<p>Increasing to 100,000 list length and 100,000 lookups only exaggerates the discrepancy? Is there a better alternative for the hash data structure in R than the native list()?</p>

<pre><code>files &lt;- c(""dir1/data.txt"", ""dir2b/data.txt"", ""dir3/data2.txt"")
for(f in 1:length(files)) {
  x[f] &lt;- scan(files[f])
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I fix this?</p>

<p>I actually have a solution for this problem, but I am curious if there is a better way to do what I was trying to do.  </p>

<p>I scraped some data from the majorleaguesoccer.com and read it into R using </p>

<pre><code>mls.reg.tmp &lt;- read.table(""../data/mls_reg_season_20100812.csv"",
                          header = F, sep = "";"")
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I used sep = "";"" because some of the attendance figures where in the thousands on the websites and I scraped ""as is"", e.g.,  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; str(mls.reg.dat$a_tot)
 Factor w/ 164 levels "" 166,060"","" 171,282"",..: 132 45 159 153 46 160 
158 148 150 98 ...
</code></pre>

<p>In hindsight, I should've just removed the commas in python in the pre-processing step of this project.  I should also point out that there were some text fields in the data set as well.  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; str(mls.reg.dat$team)
 Factor w/ 20 levels ""Chicago Fire"",..: 4 9 19 11 3 10 13 16 5 6 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Given that I want to use the attendance data as a numeric value, I converted using as.numeric and gsub.  As an example in a call to ggplot:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(data = mls.reg.dat, aes(x = as.numeric(gsub("","", """", 
  mls.reg.dat$a_tot)), y = sog)) + geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ team)
</code></pre>

<p>Question:  Is this the most efficient way of working with data such as this?  Or is there a specialized function for doing something along these lines?  </p>

<p>I'm posting the question here because I spent quite a bit of time (> 30 min) just working in this simple solution and thought that others might benefit from this as well.  </p>

I am downloading yahoo finance monthly stock price data  using R where the ticker names are read from a text file. I am using a loop to read the ticker names to download the data  and putting them in a list. My problem is some ticker names may not be correct thus my code stops when it encounters this case. I want the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>skip the ticker name if it is not correct.</li>
<li>Each element in the list is a dataframe. I want the ticker names to be appended to variable names in element dataframes.</li>
<li>I need an efficient way to create a dataframe that has the closing prices as variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the sample code for the simplified version of my problem.</p>

<pre><code>library(tseries)  
tckk &lt;- c(""MSFT"", ""C"", ""VIA/B"", ""MMM"") # ticker names defined  
numtk &lt;- length(tckk);  
ustart &lt;- ""2000-12-30"";
uend &lt;- ""2007-12-30"" # start and end date  
all_dat &lt;- list(); # empty list to fill in the data  
for(i in 1:numtk)  
{  
  all_dat[[i]] &lt;- xxx &lt;- get.hist.quote(instrument = tckk[i], start=ustart, end=uend, quote = c(""Open"", ""High"", ""Low"", ""Close""), provider = ""yahoo"", compression = ""m"")  
}   
</code></pre>

<p>The code stops at the third entry but I want to skip this ticker and move on to ""MMM"". I have heard about Trycatch() function but do not know how to use it.  </p>

<p>As per question 2, I want the variable names for the first element of the list to be ""MSFTopen"", ""MSFThigh"", ""MSFTlow"", and ""MSFTclose"". Is there a better to way to do it apart from using a combination of loop and paste() function.  </p>

<p>Finally, for question 3, I need a dataframe with three columns corresponding to closing prices. Again, I am trying to avoid a loop here.</p>

There are 6 observations in the middle of the data frame that i'd like to exclude from my analyses. All 6 belong to one level of a factor.

When I use the new data frame to plot variables by the factor in question, however, the supposedly excluded level is still included in the plot (sans observations).

<p>1) Is it reasonable to connect it to R / JGR ? or should I just create some stand-alone Java program or Python script that does the job... ?</p>

<p>2) Which part should be written in Java and which in R ? I checked Deducer's source code and found quite a bit of JAVA... which parts would you recommend doing in JAVA ?</p>

<p>3) Can you point me to other packages, and less complex than Deducer that use JGR, so hopefully I can learn from their code? </p>

<p>4) Is there another way to add some menu to the standard R GUI, that would work on ""all"" OS (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X) ?</p>

<p>I would like to create a contingency table for <em>some</em> of the columns, such as below (for brevity, I have not put sample numbers in the cells). Getting the total column/row would be great, but not mandatory, I can calculate it myself later.</p>

<pre><code>      a1  a2  a3  a4 Total
    ----------------------
    A|
    B|
    C|
    D|
    E|
Total|
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the question is how to create a crosstab based on multiple columns in R? The examples I've seen with table() and xtabs() use a column only. In my case, the columns are adjacent, so one crosstab would summarize columns a1..a4, another a5..a7 and so on. I hope there is an elegant way to do this.</p>

<p>I'm a programmer, but a newbie in R.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

After some struggles, I was able to get R built from source with the exception of the x11 headers, which means that graphics couldn't be saved using the png() function. Not a great resuls, so I upgraded to the private server package.  Their private server gives you full root access to a Debian server, so installing R was as easy as executing <code>sudo apt-get install r-base-dev</code>.  Still very affordable for a pet project, plus they don't care about long running processes, just memory usage (which is how their private server plan is priced).</p>

<p>Note the final list is mis-ordered (we know it because <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both ordered in this case). In general, I just have no way to recover the correct order from the lowest to highest quantile in Rpy. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>In addition (not in substitution, as I'd like to know the answer to the above question), if you can suggest a way to directly perform the analysis in python, that will be great too. (I don't have numpy or scipy installed.) Thx! </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: To clarify, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are <em>paired</em> but not necessarily <em>ordered</em>. For example, <code>a</code> is the size of eyes and <code>b</code> is the size of nose. I'm trying to find out that in the various quantiles of <code>a</code>, what are the means of the correspondent <code>b</code>s. Thanks.</p>

 3,12,1
 8,49,1
 12,42,1
 46,12,-1
 100,49,1
</code></pre>

<p>From this, I want to create a data frame with timestamp and (all unique keys - all unique keys with cumulative sum 0 up until a given timestamp) divided by all unique keys until the same timestamp. E.g. for the above example the result should be:</p>

<pre><code>ts,prob
3,1
8,1
12,1
46,2/3
100,2/3
</code></pre>

<p>My initial step is to calculate the cumsum grouped by key:</p>

<pre><code>items = data.frame(ts=c(3,8,12,46,100), key=c(12,49,42,12,49), event=c(1,1,1,-1,1))
sumByKey = ddply(items, .(key), transform, sum=cumsum(event))
</code></pre>

<p>In the second (and final) step i iterate over <code>sumByKey</code> with a for-loop and keep track of both all unique keys and all unique keys that have a 0 in their sum using vectors, e.g. <code>if(!(k %in% uniqueKeys) uniqueKeys = append(uniqueKeys, key)</code>. The prob is derived using the two vectors.</p>

<p>Initially, i tried to solve the second step using plyr, but i wanted to avoid re-calculating the unique keys up to a certain timestamp for each row in <code>sumByKey</code>. What im missing is a way to either refer to external variables from a function passed to ddply. Or, alternatively (and more functional), use an accumulator passed back into the function, e.g. function(acc, x) acc + x. </p>

<p>Is it possible to solve the second step in a better way, using e.g. ddply?</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mLNqy.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>However, one problem remains and that is overplotting. For example, the marked point looks like it reflects one data point, but in fact 5 data points exists with the same value at that place.<br>
<strong>Therefore, I would like to know if there is a way to deal with overplotting in <code>base graph</code> using <code>points</code> as the function.</strong><br>
It would be ideal if e.g., the respective points get darker, or thicker or,...  </p>

<p>Manually doing it is not an option (too many graphs and points like this). Furthermore, <code>ggplot2</code> is also not what I want to learn to deal with this single problem (one reason is that I tend to like dual-axes what is not supprted in <code>ggplot2</code>).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I wrote a function which automatically creates the above graphs and avoids overplotting by adding vertical or horizontal jitter (or both): <a href=""http://www.psychologie.uni-freiburg.de/Members/singmann/R/raw.means.plot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check it out!</a></p>

<p>This function is now available as <code>raw.means.plot</code> and <code>raw.means.plot2</code> in the <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotrix/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>plotrix</code></a> package (on CRAN).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Using a classic apply approach gives something completely different. Although all variables are of the same class and go to the same class, I can't get a data-frame or matrix of the correct class as output :</p>

<pre><code>&gt; str(sapply(Data,as.Date,format=""%d %B %Y""))
 num [1:6, 1:4] 12898 12898 13907 13907 13907 ...
 - attr(*, ""dimnames"")=List of 2
  ..$ : NULL
  ..$ : chr [1:4] ""Rep1"" ""Rep2"" ""Rep3"" ""Rep4""
&gt; str(apply(Data,2,as.Date,format=""%d %B %Y""))
 num [1:6, 1:4] 12898 12898 13907 13907 13907 ...
 - attr(*, ""dimnames"")=List of 2
  ..$ : NULL
  ..$ : chr [1:4] ""Rep1"" ""Rep2"" ""Rep3"" ""Rep4""
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to transform these matrices again in Date objects, you need an origin. That origin can differ from system to system, so using as.Date or another function after the apply() doesn't help much either. If you apply the origin, you get a vector again. </p>

<p>I definitely agree that in some cases, you have to be able to construct complex objects or append existing objects in a controlled manner.

I checked the book and the dedicated webpage, but can't solve the problem. I have two factors, one of which has 2 levels (presence-absence), the other 10 levels. Lets call these two ""variable"" and ""fruit"". </p>

<p>I'd like to create a stacked bar plot where each bar reflects a type of fruit and the number of presence-absence observations in ""variable"" are stacked on top of each other. This is relatively easy (see code for plot 1 below), but I would also like the bars and y axis to express the number of counts of presence-absence in ""variable"" as a percentage. In other words, all the bars should be the same height (reflecting a total of 100%) and the counts of presence-absence observations should be converted into percentages. </p>

<p>I can change the y axis scale to a percentage using  ..count..*100/sum(..count..)  but I can't fathom how to convert the actual bars. I created another plot with faceting (code for plot 2 below) that achieves what I want in terms of percentages, but I would prefer the two bars on top of each other. Does anyone have an idea of how to achieve this? I've provided dummy data and reproducible example. Thanks for any help. </p>

<p>Any ideas where I am going wrong? Is this the right way do this are is there a better way to write the file?</p>

<p>I am trying to follow Spacedman's advice and use brew. I have tried different variances of it and I either get the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>Error: unexpected input in ""cat (sprintf(""    &lt;set name=\""%s\"" value=\""%f\"" hoverText = ""&lt;%= hovertext =&gt;"" &gt;&lt;/set&gt;\n"", df$XTimeStamp, df$YVoltage))""
</code></pre>

<p>or if I get it working the hovertext remains the same the whole way down.</p>

<p>Currently the R code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if(df$BP &gt; 140 &amp;&amp; df$YVoltage &lt; -0.05){
    hovertext =""Blood Pressure High, Level of Activity Low""
}else{
   if(df$BP &lt; 140 &amp;&amp; df$BP &gt; 90 &amp;&amp; df$YVoltage &gt; -0.05 &amp;&amp; df$YVoltage &lt; 0.30 ){
    hovertext =""Blood Pressure normal, Level of Activity normal""

<p>To be honest, from this output I don't get where my bottlenecks are because (a) I use <code>data.frame</code> pretty often and (b) I never use e.g., <code>deparse</code>. Furthermore, what is <code>[</code>?</p>

<p>So I tried Hadley Wickham's <code>profr</code>, but it was not any more useful considering the following graph:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIm0J.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Is there a more convenient way to see which line numbers and particular function calls are slow?<br>
Or, is there some literature that I should consult?</strong></p>

<p>Any hints appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong><br>
Based on Hadley's comment I will paste the code of my script below and the base graph version of the plot. But note, that my question is not related to this specific script. It is just a random script that I recently wrote. <strong>I am looking for a general way of how to find bottlenecks and speed up <code>R</code>-code.</strong></p>

<p>The data (<code>x</code>) looks like this:</p>

<p>The function can return a single-row dataframe or nothing (I guess 'return ()' return nothing?).</p>

<p>I would like to apply this function on each of the rows of a given dataframe, and get the resulting dataframe (which is possibly shorter, i.e. has less rows, than the original one).</p>

<p>For example, if the original dataframe is something like:</p>

<pre><code>id size name
1  100  dave
2  200  sarah
3  50   ben
</code></pre>

<p>And the function I'm using gets a row n the dataframe (i.e. a single-row dataframe), returns it as-is if the name rhymes with ""brave"", otherwise returns null, then the result should be:</p>

<pre><code>id size name
1  100  dave
</code></pre>

<p>This example actually refers to filtering a dataframe, and I would love to get both an answer specific to this kind of task but also to a more general case when even the result of the helper function (the one that operates on a single row) may be an arbitrary data frame with a single row. Please note than even in the case of filtering, I would like to use some sophisticated logic (not something simple like <code>$size&gt;100</code>, but a more complex condition that is checked by a function, let's say <code>boo(single_row_df)</code>.</p>

<p>P.s.
What I have done so far in these cases is to use <code>apply(df, MARGIN=1)</code> then <code>do.call(rbind ...)</code> but I think it give me some trouble when my dataframe only has a single row (I get <code>Error in do.call(rbind, filterd) : second argument must be a list</code>)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Following Stephen reply I did the following:</p>

<pre><code>ranges.filter &lt;- function(ranges,boo) {
    subset(x=ranges,subset=!any(boo[start:end]))
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then call <code>ranges.filter</code> with some ranges dataframe that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>start end
100   200
250   400
698   1520
1988  2147
...
</code></pre>

<p>and some boolean vector</p>

<pre><code>(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,...)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to filter out any ranges that contain a TRUE value from the boolean vector. For example, the first range <code>100 .. 200</code> will be left in the data frame iff the boolean vector is <code>FALSE</code> in positions <code>100 .. 200</code>.</p>

<p>This seems to do the work, but I get a warning saying <code>numerical expression has 53 elements: only the first used</code>.</p>

<p>Unless there is a data frame named dat, it doesn't work. If I use <code>results=lapply(list_of_datasets, analyze)</code>, it doesn't work. 
So what gives? Without my said wrapper, I can't lapply a list of datasets through this function. If anyone has thoughts or ideas on why this is happening or how I can get around it, that would be great.</p>

For some of them which are bar charts I've used the ""Pastel1"" palette (as recommended in the book on ggplot2, pastel colours are better than saturated ones for fill areas, such as bars).</p>

<p>The problem with Pastel1 at least is that when printed on a B&amp;W laser printer, the colours are indistinguishable. I don't know if the readers will view the paper on screen or will print it on B&amp;W, so I'm looking for either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to <em>add hash lines</em> to a palette such as Pastel1 (hopefully the hash lines are also subtle)</li>
<li><em>a colour palette easy on the eyes that also produces distinct grey areas for B&amp;W</em> for, say, up to 3-4 different colours.</li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, I could find the latter by experimenting and using toner, but perhaps this has already been solved, I suppose it's a common problem. And yes, I did google for this, but didn't find anything pertinent.</p>

<p>TimeStamp | Value | Moving Average | Moving STDEVP | Lower Control | Upper Control</p>

<p>Briefly, the moving avg and the stdevP point to the prior 8 or so values in the series. Lower control at a given point in time is = moving average - 2*moving stdevP and upper control = moving average + 2*moving stdevP</p>

<pre><code>\begin{figure}[htbp]

</code></pre>

<p>it is skewed, as shown in the screen capture from <a href=""http://tinypic.com/r/v4a49w/7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>
What is wrong? I guess there is a problem with exporting from RGui in eps, as the resulted eps is also shown skewed in IrfanView. Hence I suspect that is not the LaTeX inclusion code that is wrong...</p></li>
<li><p>How could I create this graphics with a requested resolution, say 244 dpi? Is there another package/function that allows me to export eps with a specific resolution?</p></li>

<p><strong>My preferred answer</strong></p>

<p>I'm first going to look into the approach suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/211116/spacedman"">Spacedman</a>: using  <a href=""http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-designer.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QtDesigner</a> to build the UI for <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PyQt4</a> and calling R with <a href=""http://rpy.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RPy</a>.  We get a lot of students without a programming background who want to volunteer in the lab, and QtDesigner looks like something that we could train them to use effectively.</p>

<p>I would like develop GUIs directly in R as recommended by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/16632/hadley"">hadley</a> but <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/rqt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RQt</a>, which I presume that I need to use QtDesigner, does not appear to be in active development (last update was summer of 2009).</p>

<p>Also, it looks like we may have to start implementing our methods exclusively in R, and translating over from MATLAB/Octave to R.  In my field, this is probably not a bad idea anyways.</p>

I have installed the vim-r-plugin2, however, i can only send code to a seperate terminal running R. I would much rather split my screen into a buffer running R and one buffer with my .R file, and then send code from one to the other. With ESS in Emacs this seems to work, you can run a terminal/R in a buffer without a problem. I haven't found a way to make this work. The R plugin for vim uses screen, and the only way to open a buffer running a shell I could find is the Conque Shell plugin.</p>

<p>I know that unlike Emacs, Vim is designed to be a simple text editor. However, having R run in a buffer seems just so much more practical.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to get <code>ggplot</code> to display the percentage of values in that category. Of course, it is possible to create another variable with the calculated percentage and plot that one, but I have to do it several dozens of times and I hope to achieve that in one command.</p>

<p>I was experimenting with something like </p>

<pre><code>qplot(mydataf) +
  stat_bin(aes(n = nrow(mydataf), y = ..count../n)) +
  scale_y_continuous(formatter = ""percent"")
</code></pre>

<p>but I must be using it incorrectly, as I got errors.</p>

<p>To easily reproduce the setup, here's a simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>mydata &lt;- c (""aa"", ""bb"", NULL, ""bb"", ""cc"", ""aa"", ""aa"", ""aa"", ""ee"", NULL, ""cc"");
mydataf &lt;- factor(mydata);
qplot (mydataf); #this shows the count, I'm looking to see % displayed.
</code></pre>

<p>In the real case, I'll probably use <code>ggplot</code> instead of <code>qplot</code>, but the right way to use <a href=""http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/stat_bin.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">stat_bin</a> still eludes me.</p>

<p>I've also tried these four approaches:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(mydataf, aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(formatter = 'percent');

ggplot(mydataf, aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(formatter = 'percent') + geom_bar();

ggplot(mydataf, aes(x = levels(mydataf), y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(formatter = 'percent');

ggplot(mydataf, aes(x = levels(mydataf), y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(formatter = 'percent') + geom_bar();
</code></pre>

<p>but all 4 give:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Error: ggplot2 doesn't know how to deal with data of class factor
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The same error appears for the simple case of </p>

<pre><code>ggplot (data=mydataf, aes(levels(mydataf))) +
  geom_bar()
</code></pre>

<p>so it's clearly something about how <code>ggplot</code> interacts with a single vector. I'm scratching my head, googling for that error gives a single <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/browse_thread/thread/0489a702f3afc83b"" rel=""noreferrer"">result</a>. </p>

<p>It's easier to see visually by plotting x and y with a zero intercept line:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(dat,aes(x,y)) + geom_line() + geom_hline(yintercept=0)
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the plot <a href=""https://imgur.com/8pUSg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (if you don't want to download the data and plot it yourself.)</p>

<p>I want to pick out 'patches' defined as the distance along x from when the line goes above zero on the y till it goes below zero. This will always happen at least once (since the line starts above zero), but can happen many times.</p>

<p>Picking out the first patch is easy. </p>

<pre><code>patch1=dat[min(which(dat$y&lt;=0.000001)),]
</code></pre>

<p>But how would I loop through and pick up subsequent patches?</p>

<p>Comment 1:
A small function to merge a named vector with a matrix or data.frame. Elements of the vector can link to multiple entries in the matrix:</p>

<pre><code>expand &lt;- function(v,m,by.m,v.name='v',...) {
  df &lt;- do.call(rbind,lapply(names(v),function(x) {
    pos &lt;- which(m[,by.m] %in% v[x])
    cbind(x,m[pos,],...)
  }))
  colnames(df)[1] &lt;- v.name
  df
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>v &lt;- rep(letters,each=3)[seq_along(letters)]
names(v) &lt;- letters
m &lt;- data.frame(a=unique(v),b=seq_along(unique(v)),stringsAsFactors=F)
expand(v,m,'a')

As a first attempt at this I wrote a small function to calculate the banzhaf index. It takes two arguments, a dataframe that has two columns which must be labelled member and vote, and how many votes are needed for a majority (quota):</p>

<pre><code>library(combinat)
banzhaf &lt;- function(data,quota){
 f &lt;- vector()
 m &lt;- vector()
 score &lt;- vector()
 name &lt;- vector()
 pivot &lt;- vector()
 for (n in 1:nrow(data)){
  y &lt;- as.matrix(combn(data$member,n))
  for (i in 1:ncol(y)){
   for ( j in 1:n){
    f[j] &lt;- data[data$member == y[j,i],]$vote
    m[j] &lt;- as.character(data[data$member == y[j,i],]$member)
    o &lt;- data.frame(member = m, vote = f)
    }

   if (sum(o$vote) &gt;= quota){
    for (k in 1:length(o$member)){
     t &lt;- o[-k,]
    if (sum(t$vote) &lt; quota){
     pivot[length(pivot) + 1] &lt;- as.character(o$member[k])
     }
    }
   }
  }
 }

 for (l in unique(pivot)){
  score[length(score) + 1] &lt;- sum(pivot == l)
  name[length(name) + 1] &lt;- l
  }
 out &lt;- data.frame(name = name, score = score/length(pivot))
 return(out)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this function is that it becomes incredibly slow when i have more than 8 members in the dataframe. This is due to the combn() function used in the outermost loop (I think). Does anyone know how this can be made to run faster?</p>

<p>Best, Thomas</p>

<p>P.S: If you want to test it use the following data, but beware that it might run forever!</p>

For that illustration I wanted to show the errors minimized by OLS and PCA so I plotted the actuals, the predicted line and then I manually (with GIMP) drew in a drop line to illustrate a couple of the error terms. How can I code the creation of the error lines in R? Here's the code I used for my example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The values in the data vector give the values in the array in the same order as they would occur in FORTRAN, that is ""column major order,"" <strong>with the first subscript moving fastest and the last subscript slowest</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It then later gives <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Index-matrices"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a clarifying example</a> of this by loading data into a two dimensional array:</p>

<pre><code> &gt; x &lt;- array(1:20, dim=c(4,5))   # Generate a 4 by 5 array.
 &gt; x
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
 [1,]    1    5    9   13   17
 [2,]    2    6   10   14   18
 [3,]    3    7   11   15   19
 [4,]    4    8   12   16   20
</code></pre>

<p>From experience with other languages, I would think <code>x[1, 2]</code>, rather than <code>x[2, 1]</code>, would be <code>2</code>, but this is pretty easy to adjust my thinking to. However, just as quickly as I perform my mental model shift, the next example smashes it apart:</p>

<pre><code> &gt; i &lt;- array(c(1:3,3:1), dim=c(3,2))
 &gt; i                             # i is a 3 by 2 index array.
      [,1] [,2]
 [1,]    1    3
 [2,]    2    2
 [3,]    3    1
 &gt; x[i]                          # Extract those elements
 [1] 9 6 3
</code></pre>

<p>So, I can see what happened here is that we extracted elements <code>x[1, 3]</code>, <code>x[2,2]</code>, and <code>x[3, 1]</code>. Okay, but doesn't this run completely counter to above claim of ""column major order""?</p>

<p>From what I had understood, <code>i</code> should have been a <em>2 by 3</em> array, and R should have interpreted <code>x[i]</code> as <code>x[i[1, 1], i[2, 1]], x[i[1, 2], i[2, 2]], ...</code>. However, what we observe is that, instead, R did <code>x[i[1, 1], i[1, 2]], x[i[2, 1], i[2, 2]], ...</code></p>

<p>Is this a fundamental inconsistency in R, or have I completely misunderstood the documentation?</p>

<p>I've found some other writings on ""rolling"" your own MLE function <a href=""http://www.mayin.org/ajayshah/KB/R/documents/mle/mle.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. However, from my digging around - all of these functions and packages rely on the internal <code>optim</code> function. </p>

<p>In my benchmark tests, <code>optim</code> is the bottleneck. Using a simulated dataset with ~16000 observations and 7 parameters, R takes around 90 seconds on my machine. The equivalent model in <a href=""http://transp-or.epfl.ch/page63023.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Biogeme</a> takes ~10 seconds. A colleague who writes his own code in <a href=""http://www.doornik.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ox</a> reports around 4 seconds for this same model.</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with writing their own MLE function or can point me in the direction of something that is optimized beyond the default <code>optim</code> function (no pun intended)? </p>

<p>If anyone wants the R code to recreate the model, let me know - I'll glady provide it. I haven't provided it since it isn't directly relevant to the problem of optimizing the <code>optim</code> function and to preserve space...</p>

<p><em>EDIT: Thanks to everyone for your thoughts. Based on a myriad of comments below, we were able to get R in the same ballpark as Biogeme for more complicated models, and R was actually faster for several smaller / simpler models that we ran. I think the long term solution to this problem is going to involve writing a separate maximization function that relies on a fortran or C library, but am certainly open to other approaches.</em></p>

I am aware of the different ""normal"" optimization routines in R, and I am aware of parallel packages like snow, snowfall, Rmpi and the likes. Yet, I didn't manage to get an optimization running in parallel on my computer. </p>

<p>Some toy code to illustrate :</p>

<pre><code>f &lt;- function(x) sum((x-1:length(x))^2)
a &lt;- 1:5
optim(a,f)
nlm(f,a)

<p>What I want to do, is to parallelize the optim() function ( or the nlm() function, which does basically the same). My real function f() is a lot more complicated, and one optimization round lasts about half an hour. If I want to run a simulation of 100 samples, that one takes ages. I'd like to avoid writing my own Newton-like algorithm for parallel computing, so I hope somebody could give me some hints on how to use parallel computing for complex optimization problems in R.</p>

<pre><code>library(""reshape2"")
x &lt;- data.frame(1:3, rnorm(3), rnorm(3), rnorm(3))    
colnames(x) &lt;- c(""id"", ""var1"", ""var2"", ""var3"")
y &lt;-melt(x, id = ""id"", measure = c(""var1"", ""var2"", ""var3""))
</code></pre>

<p><code>y</code> then looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  id variable      value
1  1     var1  0.1560812
2  2     var1  1.0343844
3  3     var1 -1.4157728
4  1     var2  0.8808935
5  2     var2  0.1719239
6  3     var2  0.6723758
7  1     var3 -0.7589631
8  2     var3  1.1325995
9  3     var3 -1.5744876
</code></pre>

<p>now I can cast it back via <code>acast</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; acast(y,y[,1] ~ y[,2])
        var1      var2       var3
1  0.1560812 0.8808935 -0.7589631
2  1.0343844 0.1719239  1.1325995
3 -1.4157728 0.6723758 -1.5744876
</code></pre>

<p>However, when writing a small wrapper for <code>acast</code> that should do the same, i get a stupid error messages:</p>

<pre><code>wrap.acast &lt;- function(dat, v1 = 1, v2 = 2) {
    out &lt;- acast(dat, dat[,v1] ~ dat[,v2])
    return(out)
}

wrap.acast(y)

Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'dat' not found
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is obviously related to something like environments and global/local variables. As it gives other error messages after declaring <code>dat</code> in the global environment (i.e., <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> not found as long as they aren't global).</p>

<p><strong>I would like to use resahpe (especially acast) within a function without the necessity of declaring the variables outside the function. What is the trick?</strong></p>

<p>I thought perhaps something like this:</p>

<pre><code>factorCombo = paste('.(',factor1,',',factor2,')', sep='') 
ddply(ToothGrowth, factorCombo, function(df) mean(df$len)) 
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't work either. I think I am close, but not sure the proper way to do it. I suppose the entire command could be put into a string, followed by an eval() call of the string, but hopefully is there a more elegant way?</p>

<p>I'm trying t set up a <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> for a canonical correlation analysis. The original dataset has a column designating one of x conditions and subsequent columns of explanatory variables. I need to set up an array that sets an indicator variable for each condition ""x"". eg. Columns in df are:  </p>

<pre><code>ID cond task1 taskN  
A, x, 12, 14  
B, x, 13, 17  
C, y, 11, 10  
D, z, 10, 13

<p>here ""cond"" can be x,y,z,... (can vary, so I don't know how many). This needs to go to:   </p>

<pre><code>ID, x, y, z, task1, taskN  
A, 1, 0, 0, 12, 14  
B, 1, 0, 0, 13, 17  
C, 0, 1, 0, 11, 10  
D, 0, 0, 1, 10, 13  
</code></pre>

<p>So, I can set up the indicators in an array </p>

<pre><code>iv&lt;-as.data.frame(array(,c(nrow(df),length(levels(cond)))))  
</code></pre>

<p>and then <code>cbind</code> this to df, but I can't figure out how to go into the array and set the appropriate indicator to ""1"" and the rest to ""0"".</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I’ve got:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <code>data.frame</code> X with information about sample plots (<code>plotid</code>, <code>var1</code>, <code>var2</code>, <code>var3</code>, <code>var4</code>, …)</p></li>
<li><p>A polygon shapefile <code>Y</code> with spatial information for the sample plots</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Importation of the shapefile <code>Y</code> (with <code>maptools</code>) and <code>fortify</code>ing as <code>data.frame</code> <code>Z</code> (<code>ggplot2</code>) works fine. <code>melt</code>ing <code>X</code> to <code>X_melted</code> works equally fine. <code>merge</code>-ing <code>Z</code> and <code>X_melted</code> to <code>mapdf</code> works as well.</p>

<p>That means that now we have a <code>data.frame</code> in long form with spatial information and <code>var1</code>, <code>var2</code>, <code>var3</code>, …</p>

<p>Now I want to plot this data frame like this:</p>

<pre><code>pl1 &lt;- ggplot(mapdf,aes(long,lat),group=group)
pl1 &lt;- pl1 + geom_polygon(aes(group=group,fill=value),colour=""black"")
pl1 &lt;- pl1 + facet_grid(variable ~ .)
pl1 &lt;- pl1 + coord_equal(ratio = 1)
pl1
</code></pre>

<p>The result is a nice plot with one panel for each variable. The maps of the panels are identical, but fill colour varies with the values of the variables. Up to now, everything works like a charm… with one problem:</p>

<p>The variables have different min and max values. For example <code>var1</code> goes from <code>0</code> to <code>5</code>, <code>var2</code> from <code>0</code> to <code>400</code>, <code>var3</code> from <code>5</code> to <code>10</code>, etc. In that example, the legend for the fill colour goes from <code>0</code> to <code>400</code>. <code>var2</code> is nicely drawn, but <code>var1</code> and <code>var3</code> are basically in the same colour.</p>

<p>Is there a way I could use a different legend for each panel of the facet? Or is this simply not (yet) possible with <code>facet_wrap</code> or <code>facet_grid</code> in <code>ggplot</code>?</p>

<p>I could make individual plots for each variable and join them with viewports, but there a plenty of variables and this would be a lot of work.</p>

<p>Or is there maybe another package or method I could use to accomplish what I’d like to do?</p>

<p>And help would be very much appreciated. :)</p>

<p>Edit:
With the help of the <code>ggplot2</code>-package description, I constructed an example that illustrates my problem:</p>

<pre><code>ids &lt;- factor(c(""1.1"", ""2.1"", ""1.2"", ""2.2"", ""1.3"", ""2.3""))
values &lt;- data.frame(
id = ids,
val1 = cumsum(runif(6, max = 0.5)),
val2 = cumsum(runif(6, max = 50))
)
positions &lt;- data.frame(
id = rep(ids, each = 4),
x = c(2, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 1, 0, 0.3, 1.1, 2.2, 1.1, 1.2, 2.5, 1.1, 0.3,
0.5, 1.2, 2.5, 1.2, 1.3, 2.7, 1.2, 0.5, 0.6, 1.3),
y = c(-0.5, 0, 1, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 2.1, 1.7, 1, 1.5,
2.2, 2.1, 1.7, 2.1, 3.2, 2.8, 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 3.2)
)

values &lt;- melt(values)
datapoly &lt;- merge(values, positions, by=c(""id""))

p &lt;- ggplot(datapoly, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_polygon(aes(fill=value, group=id),colour=""black"")
p &lt;- p + facet_wrap(~ variable)
p
</code></pre>

<p>The panel on the right illustrates different values for <code>var2</code> on the map. On the panel on the left however, all polygons have the same colour. This is logical, because only one colour gradient is used for all panels. Could I use a different colour gradient for each panel?</p>

(Not that I dislike R, but it just interesting to try out new languages.) I like Incanter and find the syntax appealing, but vectorized operations are quite slow as compared e.g. to R or Python.</p>

<p>As an example I wanted to get the first order difference of a vector 
using Incanter vector operations, Clojure map and R . Below is the code and timing for all 
versions. As you can see R is clearly faster. </p>

<p>Incanter and Clojure: </p>

<pre><code>(use '(incanter core stats)) 
(def x (doall (sample-normal 1e7))) 
(time (def y (doall (minus (rest x) (butlast x))))) 
""Elapsed time: 16481.337 msecs"" 
(time (def y (doall (map - (rest x) (butlast x))))) 
""Elapsed time: 16457.850 msecs""
</code></pre>

<p>R: </p>

<pre><code>rdiff &lt;- function(x){ 
   n = length(x) 
   x[2:n] - x[1:(n-1)]} 
x = rnorm(1e7) 
system.time(rdiff(x)) 
   user  system elapsed 
  1.504   0.900   2.561
</code></pre>

<p>So I was wondering is there a way to speed up the vector operations in Incanter/Clojure? Also solutions involving the use of loops, Java arrays and/or libraries from Clojure are welcome.</p>

<p>I have also posted this question to Incanter Google group with no responses so far.</p>

<p>What setup do you have for developing R code?  I can't see myself actually developing r packages anywhere in the near future, but I do see myself wanting to manage my r projects effeciently, as well as create reports and presentations in LaTeX.  </p>

<p>For context, I develop my R code in Eclipse for Windows, but I have had a real hard time successfully setting up Latex/Sweave and Github plugins.  </p>

<p>Lastly, do you develop code using Windows or something else?</p>

<p>If I do something simple, as:</p>

<pre><code>for (i in 1:50)
    {
    gtkProgressBarSetFraction(progress, i/50)
    Sys.sleep(1)
    }
</code></pre>

<p>everything runs smoothly and the bar is updated every second.</p>

<p>However, when I go to my actual code, I have a loop in which I do something like</p>

<pre><code>for(i in 1:1000)
    {
    gtkProgressBarSetFraction(progress, i/1000)
    #do some heavy computation here
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that the interface ""freezes"" and the progress bar is only updated at the end of the loop, therefore defeating completely its use...</p>

<p>Am I missing something here? How can I periodically ""wake up"" the interface so that it refreshes?</p>

<p>Thank you
nico</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: OK, I solved the problem, but I still don't understand what is going on. I added a <code>Sys.sleep</code> call after the <code>gtkProgressBarSetFraction</code> and now the interface updates happily. To reduce ""wasted time"" I just did <code>Sys.sleep(0.0001)</code> (so for 1000 cycles I would only have ~0.1-1s more computing time, which is acceptable). Anyone could explain why is this happening?</p>

Blue, 3, 20, 4, 21

<p>I guess one way of doing this is by using an internal merge on each control/treatment subset (merging on the Color column), but is there a better way? I was thinking the reshape package or the stack function could somehow do it, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Dear all,
I have recently picked up the task of programming in R.
R is the statistical package / programming enviroment/language.</p>

<p>But there is horror! Because searching for R related questions
in, say, google will yield a lot of irrelevant matches simply because
'R' is, well, such a common thing a document to contain...</p>

<p>e.g. 
R non-parametric distribution fit</p>

<p>Question: Is there a better way to search for R questions in google and other search engines?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>I have 2 dataframes. The first (ants) is data pertaining to a number of sites, each site has a unique ID, some sites have more than one row of data.
It look like this:</p>

<pre><code> Site           Date          Time          Temp 
71             8-Jun-10       14:50:35       14.32

70             8-Jun-10       14:53:55       14.3      
70             8-Jun-10       14:54:09       14.3     
70             8-Jun-10       14:54:24       14.3      
69             8-Jun-10       14:56:30       14.28     
</code></pre>

<p>The second (HRsites) is an index of the latitudes and longitudes associated with each site number.</p>

<pre><code>Site    lat_52           long_00 
69      56.3075            9.1957 
70      56.4207            8.9147 
71      56.5208            8.6265  
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is...Where the site numbers of the two dataframes match, I would like the corresponding lat and long data held in 'HRsites' to be added under additional new columns in the 'ants' dataframe.</p>

<p>I see that a new column is added by 
    ants$lat_52&lt;- </p>

<p>...and this is where I'm stuck, I'm not sure of the huge range of functions available on R and feel I'm perhaps not searching using quite the correct language. Any help would be hugely appreciated....even if it's jus the terms of functions I should be searching for.</p>

<ol>
<li>A website where I can send the link to others so they can fill out, similar to Google Forms.</li>
<li>A website where only authorized users can log in to fill out data.  Think of a setting where patients are followed periodically in a research study.

<p>The obvious solution would be to hire a web developer.  However, I like doing things myself when they are manageable.  I imagine a web developer would have to know html, php, and database knowledge (eg, MySQL or PostgreSQL).  My experience in these are limited to setting up a wordpress blog on my linux server.  My experience with html is also limited as I use emacs org-mode to generate them from plain text.  I hope to hear about solutions with a minimal learning curve.  My preference of course would be free open source software and Linux-based, but I'd like to hear all available solutions (our data manager is a Windows user).</p>

<p>UPDATE 10/4/2010: Thanks everyone for the responses so far.  It appears most of the third-party solutions proposed so far has data housed in a database hosted by the vendor.

<p>If I nest my function inside the other function however, it works. It also works when I use the sfApply() in the global environment.

the only problem is that I'd like to match between the scale and the actual bars plotted.

As far as I know, the grid just gives me more memory and faster processors, so I think this question would also apply for those who are using R on a powerful computer.</p>

<p>The regression models I am running have lots of observations, and several factor variables that have many (10s or 100s) of levels each.  As a result, the regression can get computationally intensive.  I have noticed that when I line up 3 regressions in a script and submit it to the grid, it exits (crashes) due to memory constraints.  However, if I run it as 3 different scripts, it runs fine.  </p>

<p>I'm doing some clean up, so after each model runs, I save the model object to a separate file, rm(list=ls()) to clear all memory, then run gc() before the next model is run.  Still, running all three in one script seems to crash, but breaking up the job seems to be fine.</p>

<p>The sys admin says that breaking it up is important, but I don't see why, if I'm cleaning up after each run.  3 in one script runs them in sequence anyways.  Does anyone have an idea why running three individual scripts works, but running all the models in one script would cause R to have memory issues?</p>

<p>I used the list mode because I didnt get it working to separate the dataframe otherwise.

I havent not even an idea how to change the column names because its not a matrix in R termini but a list.

data. Unfortunately I cannot include illustrating picture, but basically the plot consist of tiles which either have squares and dots on them or not. </p>

<p>Each of those figures has different number of tiles on x-direction and y-direction. As a result, I cannot use  absolute units (mm) to scale the dot sizes and box sizes. Is there any way to specify the size of the dot in relative terms. For instance, like <code>geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y), size = 0.5 * tile_size())</code>. </p>

<p>The following <strong>buggy</strong> code snippet</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>df &lt;- data.frame(x=factor(c(1:4), labels=c(""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"")), y=factor(c(1:4), labels=c(""f"", ""g"", ""h"", ""j"")))</code><br>

  <code>p &lt;- p + geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y), color=""red"", size = 4, shape=15, color=""red"")</code><br>
  <code>p &lt;- p + geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y), color=""blue"", size = 2)</code><br>
  <code>p &lt;- p + scale_x_discrete(""Variables"") + scale_y_discrete(""Time"")</code><br>
  <code>show(p)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>almost achieves the desired functionality, except if I resize the graphical window or the pdf dimensions, the relative size of  points and boxes with respect to the tile sizes changes. In particular, the dots and boxes might be larger than the tile they are drawn on, which is absolute no-no. </p>

<p>If relative scaling of point size is impossible, then I would like to know is it possible to specify the dimensions of the plot area (plot without axes labels, ticks and so on) using <code>ggsave()</code> or <code>pdf()</code>. Then I could do relative scaling by myself.        </p>

<p><strong>STEP ONE :</strong> </p>

<p>I have a list of equal interval with cut_interval like this : </p>

<pre><code>myinterval &lt;- cut_interval(c(15,5,6,1,17,14), length=10)  
</code></pre>

<p>So i have two levels here : [0,10) and (10,20] </p>

<p><strong>STEP TWO :</strong></p>

<p>I want each group/class is define by my two levels in v_cut ... like this :</p>

<pre><code>id v_idn v_seed v_time v_pop v_rank v_perco v_cut
1  15    125648 0      150   1      15      (10,20]

16 18   -11152  10     120   4      6       [0,10)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 3 :</strong></p>

<p>I want to know the variability of v_rank for x axis, and time for y axis, for each group v_cut, so i need to compute min,mean,max,sd for v_rank value with something like </p>

<pre><code>ddply(df, .(v_cut,v_time), summarize ,mean = mean(v_rank), min = min(v_rank), max = max(v_rank), sd = sd(v_rank))
</code></pre>

<p>*<em>RESULT WANTED : *</em></p>

<pre><code>id  v_time MEAN.v_rank ... v_cut
1   0      2.25            (10,20]
2   0      2.42            [0,10)
3   10     2.25            [0,10)
4   10     2.42            (10,20]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>MY PROBLEM</strong> </p>

<p>I don't know how to pass step 1 -> step 2 :/</p>

<p>And if it's possible to group by v_cut like my example in step 3 ?</p>

<p>Is there a possibility to make the same things with the ""subset"" option of ddply ? </p>

<p>One more time, thanks a lot for your help great R guru !</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1 :</strong></p>

<p>I have an answer to go step1 to step2 : </p>

<pre><code>df$v_cut &lt;- cut_interval(df$v_perco,n=10)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using plyr, but there are perhaps a better answer in this case ?</p>

<p>Answer to go to step 2 to step 3 ?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2 :</strong></p>

<p>Brandon Bertelsen give me a good answer with melt + cast, but now (to understand) i want to make the same operation with plyr and ddply .. with a different result : </p>

<pre><code>id  v_idn v_time MEAN.v_rank ... v_cut
    1   15   0      2.25            (10,20]
    2   15   10     2.45            (10,20]
    2   17   0      1.52            [0,10)
    2   17   10     2.42            [0,10)
    etc. 
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying with something like this : </p>

<pre><code>r('sumData &lt;- ddply(df, .(v_idn,v_time), summarize,min = min(v_rank),mean =  mean(v_rank), max = max(v_rank), sd=sd(v_rank))')
</code></pre>

<p>But i want to have v_cut in my sumData dataframe, how can i do with ddply ? is there an option to make this ? Or merging with initial df and key = v_idn to add column v_cut to sumData is the only good answer ?</p>

It also appears that J.Chambers is using this terminology in his 2008 book, see comments for @mbq's answer. According to Chambers, the ""missing symbol"" has a zero-length string as it's contents. Thus, as.symbol("""")  should create such an object, which it doesn't in current version of R(2.11.1) ] </p>

<p>Note that ""empty object"" is not a NULL object or a vector of length 0.

<p>So, I am just looking for a way  to create empty objects for use in function's formals manipulations. I am pretty sure there must be a way in base R.   </p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; foo &lt;- function(a = 3232, b = 234){b+a}  
&gt; formals(foo)  
$a  
[1] 3232  

$b  
[1] 234  

&gt; formals(foo)$c &lt;- alist(a = )$a  
&gt; formals(foo)  
$a  
[1] 3232  

$b  
[1] 234  

$c  


&gt; foo &lt;- function(a = 3232, b = 234){b+a}  
&gt; formals(foo)  
$a  
[1] 3232  

$b  
[1] 234  

&gt; formals(foo)$c &lt;- alist(a = )$a  
&gt; formals(foo)  
$a

Recently, I've had to use our grid server environment because the datasets are too large for my computer, and the ram allocations on the grid using R and Stata are much larger than what my computer has too offer.</p>

<p>My current workflow is to open up these programs hosted on the grid (R and Stata) through ssh window connections.  I do my script editing in textmate, files that exist either on my computer or on my server directory.  When I want to run them in batch, I just submit the entire file through the ssh interface.  However, if I want to troubleshoot and run commands in Stata or R in real time, I have to write up my code in textmate, select it, then paste it into the ssh window hosting the state or R session.  </p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone knew how to configure textmate such that you can just highlight in textmate and hit some shortcut keys to send the select code directly to Stata or R in the ssh sessions.</p>

<p>How can an R script determine what platform it's running on? I'm using R 2.10.1, sometimes on Windows, sometimes on Linux. I would prefer a built-in function over filesystem taxonomy.

<p>Sample data to recreate the plot above:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- c(40.2, 43.1, 45.5, 44.5, 39.5, 38.5, 40.2, 41.0, 41.6, 43.1, 44.9, 42.8)
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone has a solution with base graphics or ggplot, I'd appreciate it!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>After looking at the details of <code>probplot</code>, I've determined this is how it generates the fit line on the graph:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; xl &lt;- quantile(x, c(0.25, 0.75))
&gt; yl &lt;- qnorm(c(0.25, 0.75))
&gt; slope &lt;- diff(yl)/diff(xl)
&gt; int &lt;- yl[1] - slope * xl[1]
&gt; slope
   75% 
0.4151 
&gt; int
   75% 
-17.36 
</code></pre>

<p>Indeed, comparing these results to what you get out of the probplot object seem to compare very well:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; check &lt;- probplot(x)
&gt; str(check)
List of 3
 $ qdist:function (p)  
 $ int  : Named num -17.4
  ..- attr(*, ""names"")= chr ""75%""
 $ slope: Named num 0.415
  ..- attr(*, ""names"")= chr ""75%""
 - attr(*, ""class"")= chr ""probplot""
&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>However, incorporating this information into ggplot2 or base graphics does not yield the same results.</p>

<pre><code>probplot(x)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h6N4F.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Versus:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + geom_abline(intercept = int, slope = slope)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vVlYn.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I get similar results using R's base graphics</p>

<pre><code>plot(df$x, df$y)
abline(int, slope, col = ""red"")
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, I've learned that the last two rows of the legend refer to the Anderson-Darling test for normality and can be reproduced with the <code>nortest</code> package.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ad.test(x)

    Anderson-Darling normality test

data:  x 
A = 0.2303, p-value = 0.7502

The functions include a large range of statistical modeling, transformations, subsetting, and plotting. Is there a 'standard' or some sufficient test?</p>

<p><strong>An Example:</strong> the test that prompted me ask this question, </p>

<p>The function dtheta:</p>

<pre><code>dtheta &lt;- function(x) {
  ## find the quantile of the mean
  q.mean &lt;- mean(mean(x) &gt;= x)
  ## find the quantiles of ucl and lcl (q.mean +/- 0.15)

  ## find the lcl, mean, and ucl of the vector
  c(quantile(x,qs), var(x), sqrt(var(x))/mean(x))
}

<p>Step 1: make test data:</p>

<pre><code>set.seed(100) # per Dirk's recommendation
test &lt;- rnorm(100000,10,1)

<p>Step 2: compare the expected output from the function with the actual output from the function:</p>

 actual   &lt;- dtheta(test)[1:3]

Since many days were not sampled, day is not continuous. So for example, there could be birds counted on day 5,6,9,10,15,34,39 and so on. I set the earliest date to be day 0.</p>

<p>Example data:</p>

<p>I need to bootstrap this data and get a resulting dataset where I specify when to start, what interval to proceed in and number of points to sample.</p>

<p>Example: Let's say I randomly pick day 5 as the start day, the interval as 30, and number of rows to sample as 2.
It means that I will start at 5, add 30 to it, and look for 2 rows around 35 days (but not day 35 itself). In this case I will grab the two rows where day is 34 and 39. </p>

<p>Next I add 30 to 35 and look for two points around 65. Rinse, repeat till I get to the end of the dataset.</p>

<p>I've written this function to do the sampling but it has flaws (see below):</p>

<pre><code>resample &lt;- function(x, ...) x[sample.int(length(x), ...)]
 locate_points&lt;- function(dataz,l,n) #l is the interval, n is # points to sample. This is called by another function that specifies start time among other info.
{
   tlength=0
   i=1
    while(tlength&lt;n)   
    {
        low=l-i
        high=l+i
        if(low&lt;=min(dataz$day)) { low=min(dataz$day) }
        if(high&gt;=max(dataz$day)) { high=max(dataz$day) }
        test=resample(dataz$day[dataz$day&gt;low &amp; dataz$day&lt;high &amp; dataz$day!=l])
          tlength=length(test)
         i=i+1
      } 
  test=sort(test)
  k=test[1:n]
 return (k)
 }

<p>Two issues I need help with: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>While my function does return the desired number of points, it is not centered around my search value. Makes sense because as I get wider, I get more points and when I sort those and pick the first n, They tend not to be the low values. </p></li>
<li><p>Second, how do I get the actual rows out? For now I have another function to locate these rows using <code>which</code>, then <code>rbind</code> 'ing those rows together. Seems like there should be a better way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that the columns 6 and 9 are read as factors and not numerics therefore I can't perform math operations. In order to convert the imported data to appropriate format I tried to create the structure dataset the following way:</p>

<pre><code>dataset&lt;-data.frame(events_a_duration=as.numeric(c(data[,6])), events_b_duration=as.numeric(c(data[,9])))
</code></pre>

<p>but checking the values I noticed that the frame structure doesn't contain the appropriate values:</p>

<pre><code> dataset[1,]


events_a_duration events_b_duration
1                   10217                    6184

<p>The values should be 615 and 47.</p>

<p>So what I don't know is how to create the frame data structure that consists of imported data columns and would be very thankful if anyone could show the way to create the appropriate data structure.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on why my code fails to faithfully produce a raster image from a matrix?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Intended Use</h2>

<p>This is for a package I am working on so I would like to stay within the R base packages if possible so as not to introduce additional dependencies.  The package implements a graphics device, so if anyone has a C level solution picks up from the info passed by <code>GERaster()</code> in <code>src/main/engine.c</code> and creates a PNG using only the R libraries, I would be willing to give that a shot as well.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Solutions for OS X</h2>

<p>As pointed out by nico, the errant behavior is the result of antialiasing.  The plot behaves as expected if <code>png()</code> is told to use an output method for which antialiasing can be disabled, such as Cairo graphics:</p>

<pre><code>png('test.png', width=5, height=3, units='px', type='cairo', antialias=NULL)
</code></pre>

<p>On OS X the default backend for <code>png()</code> is Quartz, however <code>png(..., type='quartz')</code> currently ignores directives set by <code>quartz.options()</code>.  Faithful output can be produced natively on OS X if the device is started by calling <code>quartz()</code> directly instead of using <code>png()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>quartz(file='test.png', type='png', width=5, height=3, dpi=1, antialias=FALSE)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Windows Thinks Differently</h2>

<p>The following output is generated on Windows:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eoez3.png"" alt=""Windows output""></p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Incorrect-positioning-of-raster-images-on-Windows-tp2999649p3001505.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an answer</a> given by Paul Murrell (the benevolent dictator of R graphics 
devices) on the R-help mailing list:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a rounding (truncation) problem. Working on a fix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This behavior on Windows should not be noticeable unless the raster image contains a very small number of pixels.</p>

<p>My reason for doing this is merely so that I can append this vector to a data frame along with all of the randomly generated trees - I need 2000 of them, so doing this by hand ain't quite practical.</p>

<p>All I have really been able to deduce from my previous attempts to solve this problem is that generally speaking while loops should be used instead of for loops, and many people have talked about using expand.grid, but I don't think that the latter is particularly useful in this case.</p>

<p>Of course, because its a time based average, the number of entries in a window can vary depending upon the data. This is because the number of rows belonging to a certain time window can vary.</p>

<p>I have done this using a custom function, which creates a new column in the data.frame. The new column assigns a single number to all the entries in a time window. The number is unique across all the time windows. This essentially divides the data into groups based on the time windows. Then I use R's ""aggregate"" function to do calculate the mean.</p>

<p>I was just wondering if there is an existing R function that can do the grouping based on a time interval or if there is a better (cleaner) way to do this.</p>

In the interests of performance, it was suggested that I check out the idata.frame() function from plyr. But I think I'm using it wrong.</p>

<p>My original call, slow but it works:</p>

<pre><code>df.median&lt;-ddply(exp, 
                 .(groupname,starttime,fPhase,fCycle), 
                 numcolwise(median), 
                 na.rm=TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>With idata.frame, <code>Error: is.data.frame(df) is not TRUE</code></p>

<pre><code>library(plyr)
df.median&lt;-ddply(idata.frame(exp), 
                 .(groupname,starttime,fPhase,fCycle), 
                 numcolwise(median), 
                 na.rm=TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>So, I thought, perhaps it is my data.  So I tried the <code>baseball</code> dataset. The <code>idata.frame</code> example works fine: <code>dlply(idata.frame(baseball), ""id"", nrow)</code> But if I try something similar to my desired call using <code>baseball</code>, it doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>bb.median&lt;-ddply(idata.frame(baseball), 
                 .(id,year,team), 
                 numcolwise(median), 
                 na.rm=TRUE)
&gt;Error: is.data.frame(df) is not TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps my error is in how I'm specifying the groupings?  Anyone know how to make my example work?</p>

<p>ETA:</p>

<p>I also tried:</p>

<pre><code>groupVars &lt;- c(""groupname"",""starttime"",""fPhase"",""fCycle"")
voi&lt;-c('inadist','smldist','lardist')

i&lt;-idata.frame(exp)
ag.median &lt;- aggregate(i[,voi], i[,groupVars], median)
Error in i[, voi] : object of type 'environment' is not subsettable
</code></pre>

<p>which uses a faster way of getting the medians, but gives a different error. I don't think I understand how to use idata.frame at all.</p>

<p>The subset gets created and displayed correctly, but when I try to plot it using <code>qplot()</code>, the rows which were not selected by the <code>subset()</code> also get shown along one axis.</p>

<p>The actual file I am reading in is a web server log, but I have created a small example to illustrate my problem:</p>

<p>This is the <code>ITEMSSOLD.CSV</code> file I read in:</p>

<pre><code>CUST,DT,ITEM,PRICE
BigJoe,10/13/2010,Pickup Truck,20000
TightWad,10/13/2010,USB Drive,12
Jane,10/13/2010,Smart Car,30000
Scrooge,10/13/2010,Gumdrops,1
GeekyMan,10/13/2010,Smart Car,30000
</code></pre>

<p>I read this into a data frame as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sales_df &lt;- read.table(""C:/R_Expt/ItemsSold.csv"", header=TRUE, sep="","")
</code></pre>

<p>I then did a subset to get the high-ticket items as follows:</p>

<pre><code>big_sales_df &lt;- subset(sales_df, PRICE&gt;100)

big_sales_df

big_sales_df
      CUST         DT         ITEM PRICE
1   BigJoe 10/13/2010 Pickup Truck 20000
3     Jane 10/13/2010    Smart Car 30000
5 GeekyMan 10/13/2010    Smart Car 30000
</code></pre>

<p>So that looks OK.</p>

<p>When I try to plot it via <code>qplot</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>qplot(nrow, ITEM, data = ddply(big_sales_df, .(ITEM), ""nrow""))
</code></pre>

<p>the resulting plot shows <strong>all</strong> the ITEMS on the Y axis, instead of only Pickup Truck and 
Smart Car.</p>

<p>The <code>ddply()</code> alone produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code>ddply(big_sales_df, .(ITEM), ""nrow"")
          ITEM nrow
1 Pickup Truck    1
2    Smart Car    2
</code></pre>

<p>Since the example has a small number of ITEMs, the plot is still readable, but in real life, I am trying to plot the names of slow web pages and unfortunately, <code>qplot()</code> tries to put the names of all webpages along the Y axis and it becomes a black blur.</p>

<p>I tried <code>sqldf()</code> also:</p>

<pre><code>qplot(NSOLD, ITEM, data = sqldf('select ITEM, count(*) as NSOLD from big_sales_df group by ITEM order by count(*) desc'))
</code></pre>

<p>but this produces the same plot.</p>

<p>What I understood is that <code>subset()</code> is somehow carrying the full parent information inside, instead of just the matched rows.</p>

<p>Is there any way of telling <code>subset()</code>that it should only keep the relevant information?</p>

<p>Or any other way of getting around <code>subset()</code> carrying along the empty members?</p>

<p>I know that a brute force method might be to write the result of the <code>subset()</code> into another CSV file and then read it back in a <code>data.frame</code>, but I am sure there is an easier way.</p>

<p>I've been playing around with both the <code>optim()</code> and <code>nlm()</code> function, but I can't really get what I want. First idea was to use n-1 parameters and calculate the last one from the rest, but this doesn't work (as expected).</p>

<p>you may laugh now :) .
The returned list contains a variable that can be used to assign every observation to its corresponding quantile. My question is now: is there a better way (more ""native"" or ""core"") to do it?

I had been using R for text mining already. I wanted to use R for large scale text processing and for experiments with topic modeling. I started reading tutorials and working on some of those. I will now put down my understanding of each of the tools:</p>

<p>1) R text mining toolbox: Meant for local (client side) text processing and it uses the XML library </p>

<p>2) Hive: Hadoop interative, provides the framework to call map/reduce and also provides the DFS  interface for storing files on the DFS. </p>

<p>3) RHIPE: R Hadoop integrated environment</p>

<p>4) Elastic MapReduce with R: a MapReduce framework for those who do not have their own clusters</p>

<p>5) Distributed Text Mining with R: An attempt to make seamless move form local to server side processing, from R-tm to R-distributed-tm</p>

<p>I have the following questions and confusions about the above packages</p>

<p>2) If I have just one computer how would DFS work in case of HIVE </p>

    Weight*D[Statistical Twin 1]</p>

<p>This means for VAR2002=1 and D1:</p>

<pre><code>D$D1[1]&lt;-TwinWeight[1,3]*D$D1[TwinWeight[1,2]]

<p>Unfortunately, this command is not valid in R, as D$D1[] needs a numeric value in []. I cannot name a numeric value, but rather want this number to be taken from the TwinWeight table.</p>

for(n in 1:nrow(bib)){ #  Loop over entries,
    message(n)
    keyw&lt;-strsplit(as.character(bib$Custom3[n]),""/"")[[1]]
    if(length(keyw)&gt;0){ #  If there was a keyword....
        for(i in 1:length(keyw)){ #  for each keyword, add a line with Journal, Keyword, 1
            message(paste(""i is "",i,sep=""""))
            message(paste(""l is "",l,sep=""""))
            message(paste(""journal "",bib$Journal[n],sep=""""))
            resu[l,]&lt;-c(as.character(bib$Journal[n]),keyw[i],1)

            resu$Count[l]&lt;-1

}

#Now use ddply to summarise

<p>Anyone else want to suggest anything ?</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any good ways (in R) to
weed out sets of keywords that have

<li>Is there a way to build the

(pseudocode or code in C or Java is also welcomed ... but I prefer python as it is faster to implement :)</p>

Almost have it, thanks to John Machin. The following Python script <em>almost</em> provides what I am looking for, however, when writing the output file I can see that the values in the ""headers"" I am writing (taken from the first row) do not correspond to the other rows. </p>

<p>There will be more than two functions and two patterns. My tables contains a lot of variables, which can be easily grouped by their names, which is why I use these pattern identification. It works well so far and c&amp;p these few lines is not that much of an effort. However, is it reasonable to write these lines into one function / method and let the others inherit?</p>

<p>Most help I read on OO in R  so far used examples that assigned attributes to data and then used generic functions. Unfortunately I did not understand yet if this can help my case too.</p>

<p>I have a custom function that depends on functions from non-base packages that are not loaded automagically. Thus, when I run my function in parallel, R craps out because certain functions are not available (think of the packages spatstat, splancs, sp...). So far I've solved this by calling library() in my custom function. This loads the packages on the first run and possibly just ignores on subsequent iterations. Still, I was wondering if there's another way of telling each worker to load the package on first iteration and be done with it (Or am I missing something and each iteration starts as a tabula rasa?). </p>

"4092425","1","","","2010-11-03 23:01:30","","26","821","<p>I work in a computational biology lab, where we have several folks working on multiple projects, mostly in R (which is what I care about for this post).  In the past, people would simply develop their code for each project, which may or may not involve boilerplate code copied over from previous projects.  One thing that I've pushed over the years was to bring some centralized structure to this mess and have people identify common patterns such that we can turn these repeated/common blocks of code into packages for all of the many reasons one might think that is a good thing to do.  So now our folks are using a mix of centralized packages/routines within their project specific scripts.  </p>

<p>There's one gotcha here.  We have a mandate from the powers that be that every script for every project need to be 100% reproducible over time to the best of our ability (and this includes 100% of all code we have direct access to, including our packages).  That is, if I call function foo in package bar with parameter A to get result X today, 4 years from now I should get the exact same result. (erroneous output due to bugs is excepted here)</p>

<p>The topic of reproducibility has come up now and then in R within various circles, but typically it seems to be discussed in terms of reproducibility of process (e.g. vignettes).  This is not the same thing - I can run a vignette today and then run the same code 6 months from now using updated packages and receive wildly different results.</p>

<p>The solution that's been agreed upon (which I'm not a fan of) is that if a function or package needs to be changed in a non-backwards compatible change that it simply gets a new name.  Thus, if we needed to radically change function foo(), it'd be called foo2(), and if that needs a radical change it gets called foo3().  This ensures that any script that called foo() will always get the original result, while allowing things to march forward within the package repository.  It works, but I really dislike this - it seems aesthetically extremely cluttered, and I worry that it will lead to mass confusion over time having packages bar, bar2, bar3, bar4 ... functions foo1, foo2, foo3, etc.  </p>

<p>The problem is that I haven't come up with an alternate solution that's really better.  One possibility would be to note version numbers of packages, R, etc and make sure those are loaded, but that has multiple problems - not the least of which is that it relies on proper package versioning discipline and that's prone to error.  Also, this alternative was already rejected ;)  Ideally what we'd have is some sort of notion of devel &amp; release as most of these changes tend to happen earlier on and then level off with changes happening much less frequently.  OTOH what devel really means here is ""not actually in a package yet"" (which we do), but it can be hard to determine exactly at what point is the right one to transport stuff over.  Invariably the moment you think you're safe, that's when you realize you're not.</p>

<p>So with all this in mind, I'm curious if anyone else out there has dealt with similar situations, and how they might have resolved things.</p>

<p>edit:  just to be clear, by non-backwards compatible, I'm not just talking about APIs and such, but also outputs for a given set of inputs.  </p>

<p>As the name implies, this package allows one to retroactively insert documentation currently contained in .Rd into .R files. Sounds like a promising approach for both learning roxygen and for converting packages currently in development to R packages. Woo hoo. Thanks Yihui!</p>

<p>In bash, its like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ clear
</code></pre>

<p>And I believe it's CTL-L in the Windows version of R. But how do you clear the R console in Unix-type R Consoles? Do you need to write a special function and what would that look like?</p>

<p>except each line is much longer (up to a few thousand values). As can be seen, all values are non-negative integers.</p>

<p>To put it short - this is not a normal table, where the columns have meanings. Its just a bunch of results - each set in a line.</p>

<p>I would like to read all the results, then do some operations on each experiment (row), such as calculating the ecdf. I would also like to calculate the average ecdf over all the replicates.</p>

<p>My problem - how should I read this strange looking file? I'm so use to <code>read.table</code> that I'm not sure I ever tried anything else... Do I have to use some low-level like
<code>readlines</code>? I guess the preferred output would be a list (or vector?) of vectors. I looked at <code>scan</code> but it seems all vectors must be of the same length there.</p>

<p>Any suggestions will be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Following the suggestions below, I now do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>con &lt;- file('myfile') 
open(con);
results.list &lt;- list();
current.line &lt;- 1
while (length(line &lt;- readLines(con, n = 1, warn = FALSE)) &gt; 0) {
 results.list[[current.line]] &lt;- as.integer(unlist(strsplit(line, split="" "")))
 current.line &lt;- current.line + 1
} 
close(con)
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to work. Does it looks OK?</p>

<p>When I <code>summary(results.list)</code> I get:Length Class  Mode   </p>

<pre><code>      Length Class  Mode  
 [1,] 1091   -none- numeric
 [2,] 1070   -none- numeric
   ....

<p>Shouldn't the class be integer? And what is the mode?</p>

<p>I am interested in finding the zero point of a multidimensional autocorrelation function.</p>

<p>I can generate the autocorrelation matrix from my data using </p>

<pre><code>acm &lt;- autocorr(x, 1:10)
</code></pre>

<p>However, the full matrix can be on the order of 20 x 5000, and this is computationally expensive.</p>

<p>I would therefore like to calculate only 1 or <em>n</em> rows at a time.  </p>

<p>Here are the steps that I would like to take </p>

<ol>
<li>calculate the first row in the matrix</li>
<li>while(any column has all positive values)
calculate and append the next row of the matrix to the already calculated rows</li>
<li>identify the row index of the last column to reach zero</li>
</ol>

<p>If this is the full matrix:</p>

<pre><code>acm &lt;- cbind( c(10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, -1),
              c(10, 8, 6, 5, 3, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0 ))
</code></pre>

<p>I want a function that will return 10 because the first col is the last to reach a negative value. If I calculated the full matrix first, the following would be sufficient:</p>

<pre><code>max(which(apply(acm, 2, min)))
</code></pre>

<p>But I want to avoid calculating more of acm than needed, e.g. because often only 1 or a small fraction of the rows are necessary for the calculation.</p>

<pre><code>    cumsumpi = t(apply(pi, 1, cumsum))

    getfirstindx = function(cumprobs) {
        return(which(cumprobs &gt; runif(1))[1])
    }

    apply(cumsumpi, 1, getfirstindx)

We generate three vectors. We sort values in columns <code>1:20</code> in ascending order and rows in descending order based on <code>out.tot</code> column.</p>

<pre><code># Generate data

<p><code>out2</code> has row names attached while <code>out3</code> lost them. The only difference is that I used <code>MARGIN = 2</code>, which is probably the culprit (because it takes in column by column). I can match rows by hand, but is there a way I can keep row names in <code>out3</code> from disappearing?</p>

I know I can achieve this for one of the two functions using <code>...</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foo.plot &lt;- function(x,y,...) {
    plot(x,y,...)
    legend(""bottomleft"", ""bar"", pch=1)
}

foo.plot(1,1, xaxt = ""n"")
</code></pre>

<p>This passes <code>xaxt = ""n""</code> to plot. But is there a way for example to pass e.g. <code>title = ""legend""</code> to the <code>legend()</code> call without prespecifying the arguments in the function header?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update from the accepted answer:</strong> I thought that VitoshKa's way was the most elegant to accomplish what I wanted. However, there were some minor issues that I had to get around with until it worked as I wanted.</p>

<p>At first, I checked which of the parameters I want to pass to <code>legend</code> and which to <code>plot</code>. First step to this end was to see which arguments of <code>legend</code> are unique to <code>legend</code> and not part of plot and/or par:</p>

<pre><code>legend.args &lt;- names(formals(legend))
plot.args &lt;- c(names(formals(plot.default)), names(par()))
dput(legend.args[!(legend.args %in% plot.args)])
</code></pre>

<p>I use <code>dput()</code> here, because the line <code>plot.args &lt;- c(names(formals(plot.default)), names(par()))</code> always calls a new empty plot which I did not want. So, I used the output of <code>dput</code> in the following function.</p>

<p>Next, I had to deal with the overlapping arguments (get them via <code>dput(largs.all[(largs.all %in% pargs.all)])</code>). For some this was trivial (e.g., <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) others get passed to both functions (e.g., <code>pch</code>). But, in my real application I even use other strategies (e.g., different variable names for <code>adj</code>, but not implemented in this example).</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>do.call</code> function had to be changed in two ways. First, the what part (i.e., called functions) needs to be a character (i.e., <code>'plot'</code> instead of <code>plot</code>). And the argument list must be constructed slightly different.</p>

<pre><code>foo.plot &lt;- function(x,y,...) {
    leg.args.unique &lt;- c(""legend"", ""fill"", ""border"", ""angle"", ""density"", ""box.lwd"", ""box.lty"", ""box.col"", ""pt.bg"", ""pt.cex"", ""pt.lwd"", ""xjust"", ""yjust"", ""x.intersp"", ""y.intersp"", ""text.width"", ""text.col"", ""merge"", ""trace"", ""plot"", ""ncol"", ""horiz"", ""title"", ""inset"", ""title.col"", ""title.adj"")
    leg.args.all &lt;- c(leg.args.unique, ""col"", ""lty"", ""lwd"", ""pch"", ""bty"", ""bg"", ""cex"", ""adj"", ""xpd"")
    dots &lt;- list(...)
    do.call('plot', c(list(x = x, y = x), dots[!(names(dots) %in% leg.args.unique)]))
    do.call('legend', c(list(""bottomleft"", ""bar""), dots[names(dots) %in% leg.args.all]))
}


foo.plot(1,1,pch = 4, title = ""legendary"", ylim = c(0, 5))
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <code>pch</code> is passed to both <code>plot</code> and <code>legend</code>, <code>title</code> is only passed to <code>legend</code>, and <code>ylim</code> only to <code>plot</code>. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2 based on a comment by Gavin Simpson (see also the comments at Vitoshka's answer):</strong><br>
(i) That's correct.<br>
(ii) It can always be a character. But if you have a variable with the same name as the function, then you need to quote the function name in <code>do.call</code>:</p>

<pre><code>min.plot &lt;- function(x,y,plot=TRUE) if(plot == TRUE) do.call(plot, list(x = x, y = y))
min.plot(1,1)
Error in do.call(plot, list(x = x, y = y)) : 
  'what' must be a character string or a function
</code></pre>

<p>(iii) You can use <code>c(x = 1, y = 1, list())</code> and it works fine. However, what I really did (not in the example I gave but in my real function) is the following: <code>c(x = 1, y = 1, xlim = c(0, 2), list(bla='foo'))</code><br>
Please compare this with: <code>c(list(x = 1, y = 1, xlim = c(0, 2)), list(bla='foo'))</code><br>
In the first case, the list contains two elements <code>xlim</code>, <code>xlim1</code> and <code>xlim2</code> (each a scalar), in the latter case the list has only <code>xlim</code> (which is vector of length 2, which is what I wanted). </p>

<p>So, you are right in all your points for my example. But, for my real function (with a lot more variables), I encountered these problems and wanted to document them here. Sorry for being imprecise.</p>

<p>Update: OK, so I really wanted to create a product aggregator to send the product of a column back to R. In trying to answer a futerh downstream question I got the answer that put it all together.

So I can create the product aggregator by exponentiating the sum of logs.

<ol>
<li>Read data from SQL database with sqlQuery()</li>
<li>Perform outlier analysis</li>
<li>Write offending respondents back to database in separate table using sqlSave()</li>
</ol>

<p>The table I am writing back to has the structure:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE outliers2(
    modelid int
    , password varchar(50)
    , reason varchar(50),
Constraint PK_outliers2 PRIMARY KEY(modelid, reason)
)
GO
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I've set the primary key to be modelid and reason. The same respondent may be an outlier for multiple checks, but I do not want to insert the same modelid and reason combo for any respondent. </p>

<p>Since we are still collecting data, I would like to be able to update these scripts on a daily / weekly basis as I develop the models I am estimating on the data. Here is the general form of the <code>sqlSave()</code> command I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>sqlSave(db, db.insert, ""outliers2"", append = TRUE, fast = FALSE, rownames = FALSE)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>db</code> is a valid ODBC Connection and <code>db.insert</code> has the form</p>

<pre><code>&gt; head(db.insert)
  modelid password          reason
1     873       abkd WRONG DIRECTION
2     875       ab9d WRONG DIRECTION
3     890       akdw WRONG DIRECTION
4     905       pqjd WRONG DIRECTION
5     941       ymne WRONG DIRECTION
6     944       okyt WRONG DIRECTION
</code></pre>

<p><code>sqlSave()</code> chokes when it tries to insert a row that violates the primary key constraint and does not continue with the other records for the insert. I would have thought that setting <code>fast = FALSE</code> would have alleviated this problem, but it doesn't.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to get around this problem? I could always <code>drop</code> the table at the beginning of the first script, but that seems pretty heavy handed and will undoubtedly lead to problems down the road.</p>

<p>HI
Here's the scenario</p>

<p>Speed dating: You are confident that you have a 15% chance of landing a date with any given 
candidate at a local speed dating event. At the event, you will meet exactly 8 candidates. After you talk to a candidate for 5 minutes, he/she will immediately indicate if she wants to go on a date with you.</p>

<p>The question is...</p>

<p>Through simulation, find your chances that the third candidate you meet is the first to 
offer you a date.</p>

<p>In Python/Numpy, I can easily import all the bands for the entire image into a multi-dimensional array, however, due to memory limitations the only option in R seems to be importing this data block by block, which is very slow:</p>

<p>Is there a faster/better way of doing the same thing without running out of memory? </p>

<p>The next step after this training data is collected is to create the classifier (randomForest package) which also requires a lot of memory, depending on the number of trees requested. This brings me to my second problem, which is that creating a forest of 500 trees is not possible given the amount of memory already occupied by the training data:</p>

<pre><code>myformula = formula(paste(""as.factor(V1) ~ V3:V"", dim(training_data)[2], sep=""""))
r_tree = randomForest(formula = myformula, data = training_data, ntree = 500, keep.forest=TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to allocate more memory? Am I missing something? Thanks...</p>

<p>[EDIT]
As suggested by Jan, using the ""raster"" package is much faster; however as far as I can tell, it does not solve the memory problem as far as gathering the training data is concerned because it eventually needs to be in a dataframe, in memory:</p>

<pre><code>library(raster)
library(randomForest)

# Set some user variables
fn = ""image.pix""
training_band = 2
validation_band = 1

# Get the training data
myraster = stack(fn)
training_class = subset(myraster, training_band)
training_class[training_class == 0] = NA
training_class = Which(training_class != 0, cells=TRUE)
training_data = extract(myraster, training_class)
training_data = as.data.frame(training_data)
</code></pre>

<p>So while this is much faster (and takes less code), it still does not solve the issue of not having enough free memory to create the classifier... Is there some ""raster"" package function that I have not found that can accomplish this? Thanks...</p>

<p>I am dealing with a large dataset. Can anybody advise how to iterate over a matrix two rows at a time, assign those rows to variables and pass as arguments to a function?</p>

"4198293","1","4211035","","2010-11-16 19:50:13","","4","2721","<p>I am having an issue with randomForest and the raster package. First, I create the classifier:</p>

<pre><code>library(raster)
library(randomForest)

# Set some user variables
fn = ""image.pix""
outraster = ""classified.pix""
training_band = 2
validation_band = 1
original_classes = c(125,126,136,137,151,152,159,170)
reclassd_classes = c(122,122,136,137,150,150,150,170)

# Get the training data
myraster = stack(fn)
training_class = subset(myraster, training_band)

# Reclass the training data classes as required
training_class = subs(training_class, data.frame(original_classes,reclassd_classes))

# Find pixels that have training data and prepare the data used to create the classifier
is_training = Which(training_class != 0, cells=TRUE)
training_predictors = extract(myraster, is_training)[,3:nlayers(myraster)]
training_response = as.factor(extract(training_class, is_training))
remove(is_training)

# Create and save the forest, use odd number of trees to avoid breaking ties at random
r_tree = randomForest(training_predictors, y=training_response, ntree = 201, keep.forest=TRUE) # Runs out of memory, does not allow more trees than this...
remove(training_predictors, training_response)
</code></pre>

<p>Up to this point, all is good. I can see that the forest was created correctly by looking at the error rates, confusion matrix, etc. When I try to classify some data, however, I run into trouble with the following, which returns all NA's in <code>predictions</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Classify the whole image
predictor_data = subset(myraster, 3:nlayers(myraster))
layerNames(predictor_data) = layerNames(myraster)[3:nlayers(myraster)]
predictions = predict(predictor_data, r_tree, type='response', progress='text')
</code></pre>

<p>And gives this warning:</p>

<pre><code>Warning messages:
1: In `[&lt;-.factor`(`*tmp*`, , value = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,  ... :
  invalid factor level, NAs generated
(keeps going like this)...
</code></pre>

<p>However, calling predict.randomForest directly works fine and returns the expected <code>predictions</code> (this is not a good option for me because the image is large, and I cannot store the whole matrix in memory):</p>

<pre><code># Classify the whole image and write it to file
predictor_data = subset(myraster, 3:nlayers(myraster))
layerNames(predictor_data) = layerNames(myraster)[3:nlayers(myraster)]
predictor_data = extract(predictor_data, extent(predictor_data))
predictions = predict(r_tree, newdata=predictor_data)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How can I get it to work directly with the ""raster"" version?</strong> I know that this is possible, as shown in the examples of <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/raster.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">predict{raster}</a>.</p>

What if the data frames are already in the workspace. I have five wide zoos that I cast as data frames, then melt. Here's the head of one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; head(df.mon.ssf.ret)
      date variable value
1 2009.000     AA1C    NA

5 2009.333     AA1C    NA
6 2009.417     AA1C    NA
</code></pre>

<p>I could merge these on ""date"" and ""variable"" with a series of nested merges, but that seems clumsy. Is there a more programmatic way to merge?</p>

<p>If I feel confident that the columns are in the same order in all of the zoos, can I feel confident that melt maintains that ordering and use <code>cbind</code>? Thanks!</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>There's something I'm missing about the usage philosophy of melt. Here's what happens when I merge as a zoo and melt as a very wide data frame using three of the zoos:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; temp &lt;- merge(z.ssf.oi, z.ssf.oig, z.ssf.ret)

I tried setting them inside of <code>optimize</code>, but that didn't work either. Thanks for your help.</p>

When I have a simple program that computes squares from 1 to N implemented using for-loop and while-loop the behaviour is not the same. (I don't care about vectorisation in this case or apply functions).</p>

<pre><code>fn1 &lt;- function (N) 
{
    for(i in 1:N) {
        y &lt;- i*i
    }

<p>AND</p>

<pre><code>fn2 &lt;- function (N)

    i=1
    while(i &lt;= N) {
        y &lt;- i*i
        i &lt;- i + 1
    }

<p>The results are:</p>

<pre><code>system.time(fn1(60000))
   user  system elapsed 
  2.500   0.012   2.493 
There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)

.

system.time(fn2(60000))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.138   0.000   0.137

<p>Now we know that for-loop is faster, my guess is because of pre allocation and optimisations there. But why does it overflow? </p>

<p>UPDATE: So now trying another way with vectors:</p>

<pre><code>fn3 &lt;- function (N) 
{
    i &lt;- 1:N
    y &lt;- i*i

<p>So Perhaps its a funky memory issue? I am running on OS X with 4Gb of memory and all default settings in R. This happens in 32- and 64-bit versions (except that times are faster).</p>

Facetting works great except I do not know how to control the relative space used by one facet versus another.   Am aware of space='free' but this is only useful if the ranges correspond to the desired relative sizing.</p>

<p>So for instance, I may want a graph where the first facet occupies 80% and the second 20%. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>data &lt;- rbind(
    data.frame(x=1:500, y=rnorm(500,sd=1), type='A'),

    facet_grid(type ~ ., scale='free_y')

<p>The above creates 2 facets of equal vertical dimension.  Adding in <code>space='free'</code> in the <code>facet_grid</code> function changes the dimensions such that the lower facet is roughly 5x larger than the upper (as expected).   </p>

<p>Supposing I want the upper to be 2x as large, with the same data set and ordering of facets.  How can I accomplish this?</p>

<p>Is the only way to do this with some trickery in rescaling the data set and manually overriding axis labels (and if so, how)?</p>

<p><b>Alternative</b></p>

<p>As indicated below can use viewports to render as multiple graphs.  I had considered this and in-fact had implemented using this approach in the past with standard plot and viewports.  </p>

<p>The problem is that it is very difficult to get x-axis to align with this approach.  So if there is a way to <b>fix the size</b> of the y-axis label region and the size of the legend region, can produce 2 graphs that have the same rendering area. </p>

Sweaving a large document takes ages to run, which makes efficient working quite challenging. Data processing can be accelerated very much with cacheSweave. However, plots - especially ggplot ;) - still take too long to render.
That’s way I want to use pgfSweave.</p>

<p>After many, many hours, I finally succeeded in setting up a working system with Eclipse/StatET/Texlipse. I then wanted to convert an existing report to use with pgfSweave and had a bad surprise: most of my ggplots doesn’t seem to work anymore. The following plot for example works perfectly in the console and Sweave:</p>

<pre><code>pl &lt;- ggplot(plot_info,aes(elevation,area))
pl &lt;- pl + geom_point(aes(colour=que_id))
print(pl)
</code></pre>

<p>Running it with pgfSweave, however, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Error in if (width &gt; 0) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
In addition: Warning message:
In if (width &gt; 0) { :
  the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used
Error in driver$runcode(drobj, chunk, chunkopts) : 
  Error in if (width &gt; 0) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
</code></pre>

<p>When I remove aes(...) from geom_point, the plot works perfectly with pgfSweave.</p>

<pre><code>pl &lt;- ggplot(plot_info,aes(elevation,area))
pl &lt;- pl + geom_point()
print(pl)
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:
I investigated more into the problem and could reduce the problem to the tikz-device.</p>

<p>This works just fine:</p>

<pre><code>quartz()
pl &lt;- ggplot(plot_info,aes(elevation,area))
pl &lt;- pl + geom_point(aes(colour=que_id))
print(pl)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the above error:</p>

<pre><code>tikz( 'myPlot.tex',standAlone = T )
pl &lt;- ggplot(plot_info,aes(elevation,area))
pl &lt;- pl + geom_point(aes(colour=que_id))
print(pl)
dev.off()
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine as well:</p>

<pre><code>tikz( 'myPlot.tex',standAlone = T )
pl &lt;- ggplot(plot_info,aes(elevation,area))
pl &lt;- pl + geom_point()
print(pl)
dev.off()
</code></pre>

<p>I could repeat this with 5 different ggplots. When not using colour (or size, alpha,...) in the mapping, it works with tikz.</p>

<p>Q1: Does anybody has any explanations for this behavior? </p>

<p>Additionally, caching of non-plot code chunks doesn’t work very well. The following code chunk takes no time at all with Sweave. With pgfSweave, it takes approximately 10 sec.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;plot.opts,echo=FALSE,results=hide,cache=TRUE&gt;&gt;=

plot_size &lt;- 50*50
</code></pre>

<p>This seems a pretty strange behavior as well, as only some variables are set for later use.</p>

<p>Q2: Anybody got any explanations for that?</p>

<p>Q3: More generally, I would like to ask if anybody at all is using pgfSweave successfully? 
With successfully I mean that all things that work in Sweave also work in pgfSweave, with the additional benefit of nice fonts and improved speed. ;)</p>

<p>I need to read .xls files with RODBC. Basically I need a matrix of all the cells in one sheet, and then use greps and strsplits etc to get the data out. As each sheet contains multiple tables in different order, and some text fields with other options inbetween, I need something that functions like <code>readLines()</code>, but then for excel sheets. I believe RODBC the best way to do that.</p>

<p>The core of my code is following function :</p>

<pre><code>.read.info.default &lt;- function(file,sheet){
    fc &lt;- odbcConnectExcel(file)    # file connection
    tryCatch({
      x &lt;- sqlFetch(fc,
                    sqtable=sheet,
                    as.is=TRUE,
                    colnames=FALSE,
                    rownames=FALSE
           )
      },
      error = function(e) {stop(e)},
      finally=close(fc)
    )

    return(x)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, whatever I tried, it always takes the first row of the mentioned sheet as the variable names of the returned data frame. No clue how to get that solved. According to the documentation, <code>colnames=FALSE</code> should prevent that.</p>

<p>I'd like to avoid the <code>xlsReadWrite</code> package. Edit : and the <code>gdata</code> package. Client doesn't have Perl on the system and won't install it. </p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I gave up and went with <code>read.xls()</code> from the <code>xlsReadWrite</code> package. Apart from the name problem, it turned out RODBC can't really read cells with special signs like slashes. A date in the format ""dd/mm/yyyy"" just gave NA.</p>

<p>Looking at the source code of sqlFetch, sqlQuery and sqlGetResults, I realized the problem is more than likely in the drivers. Somehow the first line of the sheet is seen as some column feature instead of an ordinary cell. So instead of colnames, they're equivalent to DB field names. And that's an option you can't set...</p>

The second one includes interpolated values from the first one. So I do not have the date anymore, however small steps for the other variables:</p>

<pre><code>  Price       Vol
   20          0.2
   21          0.21
   22          0.24
   30          0.5
</code></pre>

<p>So, while one frame shows values in a discrete time, the other one is more or less of continuous nature.<br>
Now my question: how is it possible to tell R to merge the second data frame into the first one, taking over the dates for the continuous prices/vols between the two discrete ones, to get to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Date         Price       Vol
2008-09-01   20          0.2
2008-09-01   21          0.21
2008-09-01   22          0.24
...
2008-09-01   30          0.5
</code></pre>

<p>I just cannot figure out how to do it. I always ended up with NA values for the dates which are no longer in ascending order.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your support<br>

If x1 and x2 are objects of this class (call it ""myclass""), then I would like c(x1, x2) to return a vector of myclass objects with the original class definition and attributes intact. However, the documented behavior of c() is to remove attributes, so it would seem that I need to write my own c.myclass() method. My question is, how can I do this?</p>

<p>An example of the problem:</p>

<pre><code>myclass &lt;- function(x, n) structure(x, class=""myclass"", n=n)
x1 &lt;- myclass(1, 5)
x2 &lt;- myclass(2, 6)
c(x1, x2)
[1] 1 2

<p>Here the result is just a vector of items of class numeric, and the original n attribute is gone.</p>

<p>Looking at the code for various packages, I sometimes see code like the following, in which we need to preserve the class attribute but nothing else:</p>

<pre><code>c.myclass &lt;- function(..., recursive = F) {
    structure(c(unlist(lapply(list(...), unclass))), class=""myclass"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately I also cannot get this to work. The result of calling c.myclass(x1, x2) is a vector where the vector itself has class ""myclass"" but where each item in the vector has class numeric; I really want each item in the vector to have class ""myclass"". In practice I will also need to upgrade this method to preserve other attributes as well (like the attribute ""n"" in myclass).</p>

I acknowledge that R may not be particularly well suited for sending and receiving email but it is the scripting language I know best.  I am hoping to find a way to send and receive short emails in R.  Does anybody know an established way to do this on a Windows platform? I might be able to use a combination of BLAT and GetMail but a native R solution would be preferred.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> An acceptable solution should be able to interface with servers that require SSL.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I provide my stab at a 80% answer.  Sadly an R native way is not demonstrated. Instead I use an unholy combination of system calls and command line programs that is likely to not be compatible across platforms.  R native calls will require digging into the way POP3 servers like to talk to connected clients and an understanding of SSL that I don't currently have.  Other answers are still encouraged.</p>

Participants will receive the email and respond to it.  I need to retrieve their response from my POP3 server and store it in an R data structure so that I can perform post processing on it.  In practice, I'm establishing a way to do experience sampling via R.  That is, R can email a participant ""How are you today (1 = Bad; 7 = Great)?""

The default behavior for <code>geom_smooth(method = ""lm"")</code> is to plot separate slopes and intercepts for each level of each factor. For example, with two levels of <code>A</code></p>

<pre><code>library(ggplot2)

<p>I can fit the ANCOVA separately with <code>lm()</code> and then use <code>geom_abline()</code> to manually add the lines. This approach has a couple of drawbacks like having the lines extend beyond the range of the data and manually specify the colors.</p>

<p>My data farm I am using looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Nitrogen    Species    Treatment
2           G          L
3           R          M

2           B          M
1           G          H
</code></pre>

<p>I tried:</p>

<pre><code>boxplot(mydata$Nitrogen~mydata$Species*mydata$Treatment)
</code></pre>

<p>this ordered the boxes alphabetically (first three were the ""High"" treatments, then within those three they were ordered by species name alphabetically).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTiGD.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I want the box plot ordered Low>Medium>High then within each of those groups G>R>B for the species.</p>

<p>So i tried using a factor in the formula:</p>

<pre><code>f = ordered(interaction(mydata$Treatment, mydata$Species), 
            levels = c(""L.G"",""L.R"",""L.B"",""M.G"",""M.R"",""M.B"",""H.G"",""H.R"",""H.B"")
</code></pre>

<p>then:</p>

<pre><code>boxplot(mydata$Nitrogen~f)
</code></pre>

<p>however the boxes are still shoeing up in the same order. The labels are now different, but the boxes have not moved.</p>

<p>I have pulled out each set of data and plotted them all together individually:</p>

<pre><code>lg = mydata[mydata$Treatment=""L"" &amp; mydata$Species=""G"", ""Nitrogen""]
mg = mydata[mydata$Treatment=""M"" &amp; mydata$Species=""G"", ""Nitrogen""]
hg = mydata[mydata$Treatment=""H"" &amp; mydata$Species=""G"", ""Nitrogen""]
etc ..

boxplot(lg, lr, lb, mg, mr, mb, hg, hr, hb)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives what i want, but I would prefer to do this in a more elegant way, so I don't have to pull each one out individually for larger data sets.</p>

<p>ordinal

<p>So, I want to use the gower distance function on these numbers.</p>

<p>By default, all the columns are of class ""integer"" and mode ""numeric"". In order to change the class of the columns, i use these commands:</p>

<pre><code> DF=read.table(""clipboard"",header=TRUE,sep=""\t"")      
 # I select all the cells and I copy them to the clipboard. 
 #Then R, with this command, reads the data from there.

 MyHeader=names(DF)     # I save the headers of the data frame to a temp matrix

 for (i in 1:length(DF))  {
     if (MyHeader[[i]]==""nominal"") DF[[i]]=as.factor(DF[[i]])

 }

<p>The first for/if loop changes the class from integer to factor, which is what I want, but the second changes the class of ordinal variables to: ""ordered"" ""factor"".</p>

<p>I need to change all the columns with the header ""ordinal"" to ""ordered"", as the gower.dist function says.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that just throws an error in the ggplot2 case.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Here's a partial hack.  If you want to extend the range of the scales then you can add columns to your dataset specifying the limits, then draw them with <code>geom_blank</code>.</p>

<p>Modified dataset:</p>

<pre><code>dfr &lt;- data.frame(
  x = rep.int(1:10, 2),
  y = runif(20),

  ymax = rep(c(1.8, 0.5), each = 10)
)

<p>Updated plot:</p>

<pre><code>p + geom_blank(aes(y = ymin)) + geom_blank(aes(y = ymax))
</code></pre>

<p>Now the scales are different and the left hand one is correct.  Unfortunately, the right hand scale doesn't contract since it needs to make room for the points.</p>

<p>In case it helps, we can now rephrase the question as ""is it possible to draw points without the scales being recalculated and without explicitly calling <code>scale_y_continuous</code>?""</p>

<p>One would expect that order of this vector would be <code>1:length(df.sorted)</code>, but that appears not to be the case. It looks like R internally sorts the vector according to its logic but tries really hard to display it the way it was created (and is seen in the output).</p>

<pre><code>order(df.sorted)

<p>Is there a way to ""reset"" the ordering to <code>1:length(df.sorted)</code>? That way, ordering, and the output of the vector would be in sync.</p>

<p>where X Y tells me that person X talked to Y people during the period of the survey. Now using the information from the 300 people, I want to fit this into a model. The question boils down to are there any automated ways of finding out the right distribution and distribution parameters for this data or if not, is there a good step-by-step procedure to achieve the same?</p>

<p>In particular, d_ijk represents the distance between the ith and jth unit computed considering the kth variable. It depends on the nature of the variable:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>factor or character columns are
considered as categorical nominal
variables and <code>d_ijk = 0</code> if </p>

<p>x_ik =x_jk, 1 otherwise;</p></li>
<li><p>ordered columns are considered as
categorical ordinal variables and<br>
the values are substituted with the<br>

transformed in the following manner</p></li>
</ul>

<p>z_ik = (r_ik - 1)/(max(r_ik) - 1)</p>

<p>These new values, z_ik, are treated as observations of an<br>

<li>delta_ijk = 0 if x_ik = NA or x_jk =
NA;</li>
<li>delta_ijk = 1 in all the other cases.</li>

<p>I know that there is a gower.dist function, but I must do it that way. 
So, for ""d_ijk"", ""delta_ijk"" and ""z_ik"", I tried to make functions, as I didn't find a better way.</p>

I mostly do statistical analyses using R, so I don't need a database as the backend of web pages or anything.  By datasets are generally static - they are just big.</p>

<p>I was trying to do a simple left join of a ~10,000,000 record table on a ~1,400,000 table.  The 1.4 m table had unique records.  After churning for 3 hours, it quit on me.  The query was specified correctly - I ran it limiting the retrievals to 1000 records and it returned exactly as I expected.  Eventually, I found a way to split this up into 10 queries and it ran, but by this time, I was able to do that merge in R pretty quickly, without all the fancy calls to sqlite and indexing.</p>

<p>I've been looking to use databases because I thought they were faster/more effective for these basic data manipulations, but maybe I'm just overlooking something.  In the above example, I had indexed in the appropriate columns, and I'm surprised that sqlite could not handle it whilst R could.</p>

<p>Sorry if this question is a little foggy (I'm a little foggy on databases), but if anyone has any advice on something obvious I'm doing wrong to not take advantage of the power of sqlite, that would be great.  Or am I just expecting to much of of it, and a 100 m X 1.4 m record merge is just too big to execute without breaking it up?</p>

* Clean
  - This is run on foo.csv, producing foo-clean.csv

  - This only needs to be run once, and after that, reference.
  - How can I tell org-mode to skip this?
#+srcname: clean-csv
#+begin_src sh :exports none
sed .....
#+end_src

* Explore

** Explore by a factor (1)

   - Produces a couple of charts showing there is not interaction.

I want to keep that code around, so I can bang out the plot or the analysis or what-ever and go on, but not have it run every-time I rerun everything because there's no reason to run it. Ditto with the clean-csv stuff. I want it around, to document what I did to the data (and why), but I don't want to re-run it every time. I'll just import foo-clean.csv.</p>

<p>I Googled all over this and read a bunch of org-mode mailing list archives and I was able to find a couple of ideas, but not what I want. EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS, EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS are great, when exporting the file. And the :tangle header works well, when creating the actual source files. I don't want to do either of these. I just want to execute the buffer. I would like to be able to define code blocks in a similar fashion to be executed or ignored. I guess I would like to find a way to have an org variable such as:</p>

<p>EXECUTE_SELECT_TAGS</p>

<p>This way I could simply tag my various code blocks and be done with it. It would be even nicer if I could then run the file, using only source blocks with specific tags. I can't find a way to do this and I thought I would ask before asking/begging for a new feature in org-mode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is fixed in R-patched.  (It would
  have been fixed in 2.12.0 if more
  people tested the betas...).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I've stayed away from beta -aka development- versions for a number of reasons, and these are reasons I hear from more people :</p>

<ol>
<li>I am a bit horrified it would
somehow cause conflicts with my
current R distribution. As I need it
for work, having to repair it regularly would be a loss of
time I can't explain to my boss</li>
<li>I wouldn't have a clue how to test
efficiently. I reckon every test I
could come up with has already been
run by the development team.</li>
<li>I still find it difficult to figure
out when something is a bug, and
when (most often) it is my own
stupidity kicking in.</li>
</ol>

<p>But as I understood, it would be a valuable contribution to the R community, and I'm willing to do my bit of the testing as well if I can fit it somehow into my own work. I was thinking of keeping the beta on the side and running my scripts through it as well as a checkup. Saving the constructed objects allows a quick and easy <code>all.equal()</code> to see if something is wrong.</p>

<p>Anybody some more/better ideas on how I could help testing with a minimum amount of effort and a maximum amount of efficiency?</p>

<p>I'd also like to promote this a bit more on our department as well. Apart from the ""It's time to give back to the community"", any other good reasons why testing betas is worth the effort? How can I counter the arguments given above?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>As Dirk Eddelbuettel pointed out in the comments, part of the deal is preventing the path variables in Windows. I have some ideas on that, but pointers on how to practically organize your computer for testing R-devel versions are greatly appreciated as well.</p>

So here is what I'm looking for: take the first 10 observations (e.g. date 1 = 20102006, interpolate and put a time stamp on the interpolated values (20100620). Then, take second 10 observations (date = 20100621), interpolate and put a time stamp on the interpolated values (20100621) and so on.</p>

<p>I'm quite new to R, but this is what I tried. I thought of using the zoo() function to that. Before implementing anything, I wanted to make my date entries unique, so I just added hours to each entry</p>

<pre><code>test &lt;- read.zoo(""test.txt"", format = ""%Y%m%d"")
test &lt;- zoo(test, as.POSIXct(time(test)) + 1:26)
</code></pre>

<p>There probably is something wrong with that, because R complained.
Then I thought of using the rollapply() function.</p>

<pre><code>roll.test &lt;- rollapply(test, 10, FUN = function(x,y) ksmooth(test$return,    
+ test$price, ""normal"", bandwidth = 20, n.points = 50) )
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the result is very confusing. And the by.column = FALSE demand does not work.</p>

<p>I would very appreciate some help. It does not have to build upon my ""trial version"" at all.

<p>Now my case: For my package, i'm using several libraries (jars). Each library has been licenced under one of these:  Apache v2, BSD or LPGL.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> [some clarification] I have my own java classes packed in a jar. These import classes (dynamic linking) from the libraries mentioned here [End Edit]</p>

<p>Question 1: Can i pack all these libraries in a single package?<br>
Question 1a: If yes, under what licence Apache, BSD, LGPL or any other?<br>
Question 1b: If yes, would it be enough to put all the library names in a NOTICE and to write under what licence is a library licenced together?  </p>

<p>Question 2: Or do i have to create for each type of licence a separate package and put libraries in it according to their licence type?</p>

I'd like to create comparison rasters, showing several maps side by side. It's important for this that the colour scales used are the same for all maps, regardless of the values in each map. For example, if map 1 has values from 0-1, and map 2 has values from 0-0.5, cells with a value of 0.5 should have the same colour on both maps.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>map 1 has values from 0 to 1</li>
<li>map 2 has values from 0 to 0.5</li>
<li>the colour goes from red (lowest) to green (highest)</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like a value of 0.5 to have the same colour in both maps (i.e. yellow, as halfway between red and green). The current behaviour is that it is yellow in map 1, and green in map 2.</p>

<p>I can't find a way to make this work. I can't see any way to set the range of pixel values to use with the plotting function. setMinMax() doesn't help (as 'plot' always calculates the values). Even trying to set the values by hand (e.g. g1@data@max &lt;- 10) doesn't work (these are ignored when plotting).</p>

<p>Finally, making a stack of the maps (which might be expected to plot everything on the same colour scale) doesn't work either - each map still has it's own colour scale.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how to do this?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The solution I ended up using is:</p>

<pre><code>plot( d, col=rev( rainbow( 99, start=0,end=1 ) ), breaks=seq(min(minValue( d )),max(maxValue(d)),length.out=100) )

This works great, but I want to do this over wide <code>zoo</code> objects. If I use <code>apply.weekly</code> on a wide <code>zoo</code> it sums the columns, then performs the weekly aggregation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; library(xts)
&gt; set.seed(2001)
&gt; zoo.daily &lt;- zoo(data.frame(a=rnorm(20), b=rnorm(20), c=rnorm(20)), order.by=as.Date(""2001-05-25"") + 0:19)

</code></pre>

<p>I tried the <code>apply</code> family of operators, but those seem to strip out the <code>zoo</code> date index. I can do it in a <code>for</code> loop, but it's really time-consuming (much, much more than a factor of four slower than the <code>aggregate</code> function on <code>as.yearmon</code> periodicity). Here's the <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>week.ends &lt;- index(zoo.daily[endpoints(zoo.daily, ""weeks"")[-1], ])
num.weeks &lt;- nweeks(zoo.daily)
num.stocks &lt;- ncol(zoo.daily)
zoo.weeks &lt;- zoo(matrix(NA, num.weeks, num.stocks), order.by=week.ends)
for (i in seq(num.stocks)) {
    zoo.weeks[, i] &lt;- apply.weekly(zoo.daily[, i], mean)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which works (i.e., keeps each vector separate):</p>

<pre><code>2001-05-27 -0.36663040 -0.108648725  0.8392788

<p>Is there a way to quickly operate on all columns with <code>apply.weekly</code>? Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE: Joshua Ulrich points out that I need a column aware function (like <code>colMeans</code> or <code>colSums</code>). When I do this, I get the correct answers, but as a transposed matrix. Should I just reclass and move on? Or do I have an option/setting wrong?</p>

gf &lt;- goodfit(data, type = ""nbinomial"", method = ""MinChisq"")

<p>But after the <code>gf &lt;- ...</code> step, R complains saying:</p>

<pre><code>Warning messages:

2: In pnbinom(q, size, prob, lower.tail, log.p) : NaNs produced
3: In pnbinom(q, size, prob, lower.tail, log.p) : NaNs produced

<p>and when I say <code>plot</code> it complains:</p>

<pre><code>Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : 
  'x' is a list, but does not have components 'x' and 'y'

<p>I am not sure what is happening because if I set <code>data</code> to be the following:</p>

<p>On the other side, R is like Matlab, and has scalar, vector, data frame, array and list as its data types.

<p>My goal is to create a Markov transition matrix (probability of moving from one state to another) with the 'highest traffic' portion of the matrix occupying the top-left section. Consider the following sample:</p>

<pre><code>inputData &lt;- c(
    c(5, 3, 1, 6, 7),
    c(9, 7, 3, 10, 11),
    c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
    c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10),
    c(9, 5, 2, 1, 1)
    )

MAT &lt;- matrix(inputData, nrow = 5, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(MAT) &lt;- c(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"")
rownames(MAT) &lt;- c(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"")

rowSums(MAT)
</code></pre>

<p>I wan to re-arrange the elements of this matrix such that the elements with the largest row sums are placed to the top-left, in descending order. Does this make sense? In this case the order I'm looking for would be B, D, A, E, C Any thoughts?</p>

<p>As an aside, here is the function I've written to construct the transition matrix. Is there a more elegant way to do this that doesn't involve a double transpose?</p>

<pre><code>TMAT &lt;- apply(t(MAT), 2, function(X) X/sum(X))
TMAT &lt;- t(TMAT)
</code></pre>

<p>I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>TMAT &lt;- apply(MAT, 1, function(X) X/sum(X))
</code></pre>

<p>But my the custom function is still getting applied over the columns of the array, rather than the rows. For a check try:</p>

<pre><code>rowSums(TMAT)
colSums(TMAT)
</code></pre>

<p>Row sums here should equal 1...</p>

<p>Hi im new to R and new to programming.  This is a subset of the MP's expenses during a certain time period.  I want to subtotal each MP's expenses and i used the code from another post</p>

<pre><code>&gt; aggregate(cbind(bsent, breturn, tsent, treturn, csales) ~ yname, data = foo, 
 +           FUN = sum)

<p>my code:</p>

<pre><code>expenses2 &lt;- aggregate(cbind(Amount..Â.) ~ Name.of.member, data = expenses, FUN = sum)
</code></pre>

<p>now although this code does do some sort of aggregation the numbers do not match up.  for example one can calculate that Adam Afriyie's expenses are £273.93 however this code gives a result of 12697.  I have no idea what this number represents.  Can someone help me and tell me what im doing wrong??   </p>

<p>Thanks! Two questions:</p>

<p>(1) if function <code>test</code> further takes an argument for <code>f</code>, will you add something like <code>test &lt;- function(g.=g, T=1, f..=f){ g.(1,T, f.=f..) }</code> ? In cases with more recursions, is it a good and safe practice adding more <em>.</em>? </p>

<p>(2) if <code>f</code> is a non-function argument, for example <code>g &lt;- function(x, T, f=f){ exp(-f*x/T) }</code> and <code>test &lt;- function(g.=g, T=1, f=f){ g.(1,T, f=f.) }</code>, will using the same name for both formal and actual non-functional arguments a good and safe practice or it may cause some potential trouble? </p>

<p><strong>My goal:</strong> I want to calculate the percentage of instances in an data.frame which have a result higher than 0. I've tried this with the for loop, but to no avail. So, after some more searching I used the apply function to calculate various metrics as mean, sd, and min/max. This works great, but for calculating the percentage the apply function doesn't work, even when I make a custom function, and insert this into the apply function.</p>

<p>This is the shortened version of my data.frame:</p>

<pre><code>     tradesList[c(1:5,10:15),c(1,7)]
   Instrument TradeResult.Currency.
1         JPM                    -3
2         JPM                   264
3         JPM                   284
4         JPM                    69
5         JPM                   283

15        KFT                  -206
</code></pre>

<p>I want to summarize this data.frame, for example by displaying the average TradeResult for each Instrument:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; tapply(tradesList$TradeResult.Currency., tradesList$Instrument, mean)
 JPM  KFT 
42.3 14.6 
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would also like to calculate the percentage of rows which have an TradeResult > 0 per instrument. With the 'which' function checking for instances which are > 0 does work, however, apply won't accept this function as an argument. </p>

<pre><code>&gt; length(which(tradesList$TradeResult.Currency. &gt; 0)) / length(tradesList$TradeResult.Currency.) * 100
[1] 50
&gt; tapply(tradesList$TradeResult.Currency., tradesList$Instrument, (length(which(tradesList$TradeResult.Currency. &gt; 0)) / length(tradesList$TradeResult.Currency.) * 100))
Error in match.fun(FUN) :

&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I searched in the help function for more information on this error, and tried various different ways of formulating the function (for example with brackets or quotes), but each way led to the same result.</p>

<p>Does someone know a whay to calculate the percentage of instances which are greater than zero? Perhaps I'm missing something?</p>

<p>I have several data sets to plot in R, each consisting of two columns of data: time, date.  I am using R 2.11.0 on a Windows computer, via the Rgui.</p>

<p>Time is ""time of day"" that an event is observed. As an example, it is recognized as:</p>

<pre><code>Factor w/ 87 levels ""5:53"",""5:54"",..: 84 85 85 85 86 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Date is calendar date, recognized as:</p>

<pre><code>Class 'Date'  num [1:730] 13879 13880 13881 13882 13883 ...
</code></pre>

<p>The time values are recorded in the format of a 24-hr clock, h:mm or hh:mm.  The date values are displayed yyyy-mm-dd.</p>

<p>I want to plot time (y-axis) vs. date (x-axis).  </p>

<p>Using </p>

<pre><code>plot(date,time)
</code></pre>

<p>gives an accurate-looking plot, but the y-axis is labeled as the numeric factor values (about 0 to 90), rather than the desired, temporally-ordered levels of the factor variable.  The x-axis is labeled in the desired, human-readable format.</p>

<p>How can I correct this?  Is there a ""time of day"" format in R that I can convert my ""time"" variable into?  I will subsequently like to do arithmetic on the time values as well, and would not mind having to carry one column of values to use in plotting and one column of values for maths.</p>

<p>I ran across several examples online of manipulation of (date + time) variables in R, and converting those to different formats.  I do not believe this is my problem, as I have separate fields for time and date and want to plot one against the other.</p>

    sum(x) / length(which(x &gt; 0)),
    return(0))
    }

<pre><code>&gt; with(tmpData, tapply(TradeResult.Currency., Instrument, avgProfit))

&gt; avgProfit(tmpData$TradeResult.Currency.)

&gt; x
 [1] 1 1 2 1 2 3 3 3 4 4

<p>(The values should be 225 for JPM (total of 900 divided by 4 instances which where greater than zero) and 116 for KFT)</p>

<p>Even though I calculate the sum of x (which, if I understand correctly, should be the sum of the individual values in the data.frame) in the function, the output of the variable 'x' puzzles me. I can't find where these 1,2,3 and fours are coming from.</p>

<p>How can I calculate an conditional sum? Besides, do I need to use an function or am I making it too complicated (perhaps there is an build-in R function for this which I overlooked?)</p>

<p>However, on Vista (R 2.12.0, JRI 0.5.0) when the application evaluates ""library(ptw)"" the following error occurs:</p>

<p>Error in library(ptw) : object 'ptw' not found</p>

<p>When I run R from the Vista command-line and issue the ""library(ptw)"" command there is no problem.</p>

<p>If I copy the ptw package from my %USERPROFILE%\Documents\R\win-library to %R_HOME%\library then the problem goes away. However, I don't want my users to have to do this, in fact, some might not have permission to do so.</p>

<p>Therefore, how can I get JRI to invoke an R-Engine that has access to packages that the user has installed in their
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\R\win-library? </p>

<p>I've also <a href=""http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e12/help/10/12/7087.html"" rel=""nofollow"">asked</a> on the r-help mailing list but no joy.</p>

<p>I am aware of the <em>libloc</em> parameter for the library() function but I'd prefer something a little less fragile, i.e. automatic rather than requiring configuration...</p>

<p>Say we do :</p>

<p>We get no output. Logic, as both expressions are actually assignments of a vector dd. eval() is not supposed to give output then. But strangely enough, when you try the funny code</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ifelse(z==0,eval(x),eval(y))
[1] 4 2
</code></pre>

<p>You get output??? Somebody has an explanation for this?</p>

<p>It's not as simple as ""R evaluates and then uses dd"". Whatever order you give z, whatever condition you use, dd is always the last mentioned <code>eval()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ifelse(z==0,eval(x),eval(y))
&gt; dd
[1] 4 5 6

&gt; ifelse(z==1,eval(x),eval(y))
&gt; dd

&gt; z &lt;- c(0,1)

&gt; ifelse(z==1,eval(y),eval(x))
&gt; dd

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>a closer look at the source code of ifelse shows that the line making sure this happens, is the <code>rep()</code> :</p>

<pre><code>&gt; x &lt;- expression(dd &lt;- 1:3)
&gt; eval(x)
&gt; rep(eval(x),2)

<p>I am trying to fit a distribution to a 95% CI and mode.
The cost function that I am using solves three functions for 0: P(X=2.5 | mu, sigma)=0.025, P(X=7.5|mu, sigma)=0.975, and the mode of log-N(mu, sigma) = 3.3. note: mode of a lognormal is = $e^{\mu-\sigma^2)}$:</p>

<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>

<p>First I write a cost function, <code>prior</code></p>

<pre><code>prior &lt;- function(parms) {
  a &lt;- abs(plnorm(2.5, parms[1], parms[2]) - 0.025)
  b &lt;- abs(plnorm(7.5, parms[1], parms[2]) - 0.975)
  mode &lt;- exp(parms[1] - parms[2]^2)
  c &lt;- abs(mode-3.3)
  return(a + b + c)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then I seek parameters that minimize the cost function</p>

<pre><code>v = nlm(prior,c(log(3.3),0.14))
</code></pre>

<p>It is apparent that the function is maximized for the mode an LCL but not the UCL.</p>

<pre><code>abs(plnorm(7.5, parms[1], parms[2]) - 0.975)
&gt; [1] 0.02499989
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a plot with dotted lines at the desired 95%CI:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- seq(0,10,0.1)
plot(x,dlnorm(x, v$estimate[1],v$estimate[2]),type='l')
abline(v=c(2.5,7.5), lty=2) #95%CI
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>The optimization two points closely and all of the error is in the third. However, I would like it to fit the points evenly.</p>

<p>How can I get the function to give equal weight to the magnitude of the <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> terms? It appears that the function is only fitting <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>. </p>

<p><em>note:</em> This question is based on one asked at [cross validated][1] except that this version is specifically about the function of R's nlm() optimization algorithm whereas the CV question is about finding the a more appropriate distribution.</p>

  <p>שלום</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Peace, in Hebrew)
Should be this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But instead, both commands translate it to:</p>

<pre><code>URLencode(""שלום"")

Whenever I'm about to write some function, I use <code>require(&lt;pkgname&gt;)</code>, but I was always thinking about using <code>::</code> instead. Using <code>require</code> in custom functions is better practice than <code>library</code>, since <code>require</code> returns warning and <code>FALSE</code>, unlike <code>library</code>, which returns error if you provide a name of non-existent package.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <code>::</code> operator gets the variable from the package, while <code>require</code> loads whole package (at least I hope so), so speed differences came first to my mind. <code>::</code> must be faster than <code>require</code>.</p>

<p>And I did some analysis in order to check that - I've written two simple functions that load <code>read.systat</code> function from <code>foreign</code> package, with <code>require</code> and <code>::</code> respectively, hence import <code>Iris.syd</code> dataset that ships with <code>foreign</code> package, replicated functions 1000 times each (which was shamelessly arbitrary), and... crunched some numbers.</p>

<p>Strangely (or not) I found significant differences in terms of user CPU and elapsed time, while there were no significant differences in terms of system CPU. And yet more strange conclusion: <code>::</code> is actually slower! Documentation for <code>::</code> is very blunt, and just by looking at sources it's obvious that <code>::</code> should perform better!</p>

<p><strong>require</strong></p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/r

## with require
fn1 &lt;- function() {
  require(foreign)
  read.systat(""Iris.syd"", to.data.frame=TRUE)
}

<p>Grab CSV data <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8566396/sim/require%20vs%20colon/require_colon_sim.csv"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. Some stats:</p>

<pre><code>user CPU:     W = 475366    p-value = 0.04738  MRr =  975.866    MRc = 1025.134

<p>MRr is mean rank for <code>require</code>, MRc ibid for <code>::</code>. I must have done something wrong here. It just doesn't make any sense... Execution time for <code>::</code> seems way faster!!! I may have screwed something up, you shouldn't discard that option...</p>

<p>OK... I've wasted my time in order to see that there is some difference, and I carried out completely useless analysis, so, back to the question:</p>

<p>When I run this file from TextMate with the Command R keystroke, I get four charts lined up in a 2 x 2 grid, as you'd expect from the par() function. When I source this from the R console, </p>

<pre><code>&gt; source(""~/myChartSeries.r"")
</code></pre>

<p>I get a flash of each chart with the last one depicted alone. The last I'd heard, chartSeries() was not compliant with the par() function but chart_Series() is. So the behavior of the console is not surprising. But why does execution from TextMate work? Has chartSeries() been made par() compliant and is the R console execution flawed?</p>

<pre><code>myhist = data.frame(size = 10:27, counts = c(1L, 3L, 5L, 6L, 9L, 14L, 13L, 23L, 31L, 40L, 42L, 22L, 14L, 7L, 4L, 2L, 2L, 1L) )

qplot(x=size, y=counts, data=myhist)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GzL0i.png"" alt=""plot1""></p>

<p>Since I want counts, I need to add a normalization factor (N) to scale up the density:</p>

<pre><code>fit = nls(counts ~ N * dnorm(size, m, s), data=myhist, start=c(m=20, s=5, N=sum(myhist$counts)) )   
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create the fitted data for display and everything works great:</p>

<pre><code>x = seq(10,30,0.2)
fitted = data.frame(size = x, counts=predict(fit, data.frame(size=x)) )
ggplot(data=myhist, aes(x=size, y=counts)) + geom_point() + geom_line(data=fitted)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eumh1.png"" alt=""plot2""></p>

<p>I got excited when I found this thread which talks about using geom_smooth() to do it all in one step, but I can't get it to work:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/r-help@r-project.org/msg109882.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mail-archive.com/r-help@r-project.org/msg109882.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what I try... and what I get:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(data=myhist, aes(x=size, y=counts)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=""nls"", formula = counts ~ N * dnorm(size, m, s), se=F, start=list(m=20, s=5, N=300, size=10))

Error in method(formula, data = data, weights = weight, ...) : 
  parameters without starting value in 'data': counts
</code></pre>

<p>The error seems to indicate that it's trying to fit for the observed variable, <strong>counts</strong>, but that doesn't make any sense, and it predictably freaks out if I specify a ""starting"" value for counts too:</p>

<pre><code>fitting parameters ‘m’, ‘s’, ‘N’, ‘size’, ‘counts’ without any variables

Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'counts' not found
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea what I'm doing wrong?  It's not the end of the world, of course, but fewer steps are always better, and you guys always come up with the most elegant solutions to these common tasks.</p>

I’ve tried various classes (<code>timeDate</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>timeSeries</code>, <code>POSIXct</code>, <code>POSIXlt</code>) but without success. Perhaps I’m just overlooking the obvious and because I’ve tried so many approaches I just don’t know what’s what anymore. I hope some of you can shed some light on where I go wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong>: 
I want to calculate the difference between two dates using the earliest and latest date. I got this working with <code>head()</code> and <code>tail()</code>, but because those values aren’t necessary the earliest and latest date in my data, I need another way. (I can’t get the sorting of data to work, because it sorts the data only on the day of the date.)</p>

<p><strong>Second goal</strong>: I want to convert the dates from daily format (i.e. 8-12-2010) to weekly, monthly, and yearly levels (i.e. '49-2010', 'december-10', and just '2010'). This can be done with the format settings (like <code>%d-%m-%y</code>). Can this be done with converting the data.frame to an time class, and than transforming the timeclass in the right format <code>(8-12-2010 -&gt; format(""%B-%y"") -&gt; 'december-10'</code>), and then transforming that time class into an factor with levels for each month?</p>

<p>I have data frame which looks like this. I have prices, 3 X's and 2 R's.</p>

<pre><code>Date    Name  Price  Interest
01.02.10 X  120     0.2
01.02.10 R  120     0.3
01.02.10 X  130     0.8
01.02.10 X  140     0.4
01.02.10 R  130     0.2
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to tell R to look for pairs of X&amp;Rs with the same price, and delete the rest. So this should result: 2 X's and 2'Rs (in this case).</p>

<pre><code>Date    Name  Price  Interest
01.02.10 X  120     0.2
01.02.10 R  120     0.3
01.02.10 X  130     0.8
01.02.10 R  130     0.2
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>To make it clearer (hopefully): I have a lot of different prices for each date. Each row either has an X or an R in it. There are a lot of pairs on each date, i.e. for example X, Price = 120 &amp; R, Price = 120 on Date 1. But there are also Prices which only match one Name, for example there is a Price = 140 only for Name = X. So what i would like R to do is: check for machting Names for one Price (i.e. there exists the same Price for one X and one R) and delete the rest. What actually would result is the same number of X's and R's because I'm looking for pairs.</p>

<p>I'm sorry not to be able to post something I tried. I just couldn't think of anything.</p>

<p>Now, to the next problem:
If the pairs are there, I would like to tell R to check each line. If the Name is X, I want it to calculate a new price, if not just print the existing price.
I tried</p>

<pre><code>xx &lt;- if(Name == ""X""){Price + 100*interest} else print{Price}
</code></pre>

<p>but it didn't work.</p>

<p>Thanks for help </p>

I have 6 parameters for which I know maxi and mini values. I have a complex function that includes the 6 parameters and return a 7th value (say Y). I say complex because Y is not directly related to the 6 parameters; there are many embeded functions in between.</p>

<ol>
<li>I would like to find the combination of the 6 parameters which returns the highest Y value. I  first tried to calculate Y for every combination by constructing an hypercube but I have not enough memory in my computer. So I am looking for kinds of markov chains which progress in the delimited parameter space, and are able to overpass local peaks.</li>
<li>when I give one combination of the 6 parameters, I would like to know the highest local Y value.

<p>I have a dataframe of probability distributions that I would like to calculate statistical summaries for: </p>

<pre><code>priors &lt;- structure(list(name = c(""theta1"", ""theta2"", ""theta3"", ""theta4"", 
  ""theta5""), distn = c(""gamma"", ""beta"", ""lnorm"", ""weibull"", ""gamma""), 
   parama = c(2.68, 4, 1.35, 1.7, 2.3), paramb = c(0.084, 7.2, 0.69, 0.66, 3.9),
   another_col = structure(c(3L, 4L, 5L, 1L, 2L
   ), .Label = c(""1"", ""2"", ""a"", ""b"", ""c""), class = ""factor"")), 
   .Names = c(""name"", ""distn"", ""parama"", ""paramb"", ""another_col""), row.names = c(""1"",
   ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5""), class = ""data.frame"")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>

<p>Step 1: I wrote a function to calculate the summaries and returning <code>mean(lcl, ucl)</code></p>

<pre><code> summary.stats &lt;- function(distn, A, B) {
  if (distn == 'gamma'  ) ans &lt;- c(A*B,                       qgamma(c(0.05, 0.95), A[ ], B))
  if (distn == 'lnorm'  ) ans &lt;- c(exp(A + 1/2 * B^2),        qlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95), A, B))
  if (distn == 'beta'   ) ans &lt;- c(A/(A+B),                   qbeta( c(0.05, 0.95), A, B))
  if (distn == 'weibull') ans &lt;- c(mean(rweibull(10000,A,B)), qweibull(c(0.05, 0.95), A, B))
  if (distn == 'norm'   ) ans &lt;- c(A,                         qnorm( c(0.05, 0.95), A, B))
  ans &lt;- (signif(ans, 2))
  return(paste(ans[1], ' (', ans[2], ', ', ans[3],')', sep = ''))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2: I would like to add a new column to my dataframe called <code>stats</code></p>

<pre><code>priors$stats &lt;- ddply(priors, 
                     .(name, distn, parama, paramb), 
                     function(x)  summary.stats(x$distn, x$parama, x$paramb))$V1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>

<p>what is the proper way to do this? I get an error when I try </p>

<pre><code>                ddply(priors, 
                     .(name, distn, parama, paramb),
                     transform, 
                     stats = function(x)  summary.stats(x$distn, x$parama, x$paramb))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> (extra credit)</p>

<p>Is there a more efficient way to code the <code>summary.stats</code> function, i.e., with less 'if's'?</p>

Browsing through the source code or browsing on the net, you see a lot of different styles displayed.</p>

<p>The main trends in my code :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>heavy vectorization</strong> I play a lot with the indices (and nested indices), which results in rather obscure code sometimes but is generally a lot faster than other solutions.
eg: <code>x[x &lt; 5] &lt;- 0</code> instead of <code>x &lt;- ifelse(x &lt; 5, x, 0)</code></p></li>
<li><p>I tend to <strong>nest functions</strong> to avoid overloading the memory with temporary objects that I need to clean up. Especially with functions manipulating large datasets this can be a real burden. eg : <code>y &lt;- cbind(x,as.numeric(factor(x)))</code> instead of <code>y &lt;- as.numeric(factor(x)) ; z &lt;- cbind(x,y)</code></p></li>
<li><p>I write a <strong>lot of custom functions</strong>, even if I use the code only once in eg. an <code>sapply</code>. I believe it keeps it more readible without creating objects that can remain lying around.</p></li>
<li><p>I <strong>avoid loops at all costs</strong>, as I consider vectorization to be a lot cleaner (and faster)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, I've noticed that opinions on this differ, and some people tend to back away from what they would call my ""Perl"" way of programming (or even ""Lisp"", with all those brackets flying around in my code. I wouldn't go that far though). </p>

<p>What do you consider good coding practice in R?</p>

<p>What is your programming style, and how do you see its advantages and disadvantages? </p>

<pre><code>pp + geom_text(aes(x=20, y=-5, label=paste(""italic(r) =="", 3, ""Q"", sep="" "")), 
    parse=TRUE, colour=""black"")
</code></pre>

<p>(yes, I know a correlation of 3 is impossible, just an example).</p>

<p>I would like to do:</p>

<pre><code>pp + geom_text(aes(x=20, y=-5, label=paste(""italic(r) =="", round(val$estimate, digits=2), ""\np &lt; 0.0001"", sep="" "")),     parse=TRUE, colour=""black"")
</code></pre>

<p>But this generates the same error, now at the \n thingy. What am I doing wrong?</p>

I estimate molecular ages using the chronopl function, resulting in a ultrametric, binary tree. From which I want to create a R build in dendrogram object. </p>

<p>The tree plots fine, and is a real phylo object. However i'm running into problems when trying to convert it:</p>

<p><strong>Minimal Working Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>require(ape)
test.tree &lt;- read.tree(file = ""testree.phylip"", text = NULL, tree.names = NULL, skip = 0,
    comment.char = ""#"", keep.multi = FALSE)

test.tree.nu &lt;- chronopl(test.tree, 0, age.min = 1, age.max = NULL,
node = ""root"", S = 1, tol = 1e-8,
CV = FALSE, eval.max = 500, iter.max = 500)

is.ultrametric(test.tree.nu)
is.binary.tree(test.tree.nu)
treeclust &lt;- as.hclust.phylo(test.tree.nu)
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting tree ""looks"" fine,
I test to make sure the tree is not ultrametric and binary, and want to convert it into a hclust object, to make eventually a dendrogram object of it.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; is.binary.tree(test.tree.nu)
[1] TRUE
&gt; is.ultrametric(test.tree.nu)
[1] TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>After trying to make a hclust object out of the tree, I get an error:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; tree.phylo &lt;- as.hclust.phylo(test.tree.nu)
Error in if (tmp &lt;= n) -tmp else nm[tmp] : 
  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
In addition: Warning message:

</code></pre>

<p>I realize this is a very detailed question, and perhaps such questions which are specifically related to certain packages are better asked somewhere else, but I hope someone is able to help me.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>I have a test function 'foo.R' in my package 'PKG'; foo.R consists of:</p>

  if (n&gt;1)  text &lt;- gsub(""\\#GGG"", '', text)

}
</code></pre>

<p>The intent of foo is to either uncomment lines by replacing ""#GGG"" with """" when n>1 or to leave the line commented if n == 1</p>

<p>The minimal code required to produce this error is:</p>

<pre><code>foo &lt;- function (string) {
    gsub(""\\#GGG"", '', string)
}

<p>However, when I run <code>R CMD INSTALL PKG</code> I get the following error:</p>

<p>Ideally I want the first column to remain numeric, whilst the second is converted to a string. The solution needs to be fully automated, as I am working with data sets with a large number of columns, and I can't always predict which ones will be factor and which will be numeric.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I've tried to get around this problem by defining the following function:</p>

<pre><code>to.xts &lt;- function(data) {

    timestamp &lt;- as.POSIXct(data[,1])
    coredata &lt;- data[,-1]

    headers &lt;- names(coredata)
    data.type &lt;- c()

    for (header in headers) {
        data.type[headers==header] &lt;- class(coredata[[header]])
    }

    data.factor  &lt;- xts(coredata[,data.type==""factor""],timestamp)
    data.numeric &lt;- xts(coredata[,data.type==""numeric""],timestamp)

    data.xts &lt;- cbind(data.factor,data.numeric)

}
</code></pre>

<p>but when merging the two XTS objects, the string data is converted to NAs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; x

<p>After a while of my updating of R from 2.11.1 to 2.12.0, I was now completely unable to pass scripts to R from Notepad++ (working together with nppToR).</p>

<p>when I installed nppToR, I always get the same dialogue of <code>""Could not find the Rgui.exe file. Aborting""</code>, and it will not ready for use. I thought it is caused by the updating of R.2.11.1 to R.2.12.0 because the Rgui.exe were located in different location. Then, for a while, the nppToR works after I edit the nppToR.ini file, from this:</p>

<pre><code>[install]
global=1
</code></pre>

<p>into this, which is also from the previous version of the nppToR files:</p>

<pre><code>[executables]

appendnewline=1
[silent]
enablesilent=1
silentkey=!F8
[install]

</code></pre>

<p>However, in these days, this modification never work for me, even though I uninstalled the R.2.12.0 and installed R.2.11.1. And I really have no idea the reason for that. Is there some one had the same experiences? Or, can some one help me out?</p>

<p>PS.: I also tried Tinn-R as an alternative, but after some time of use, the cursor usually appear in some position just like it is going mad, and when I input the code, each line can have only one single letter, and the cursor will move to the next line automatically.Do any body know why?</p>

<p>Thank in advance~</p>

<p>But it didn't work. I really have difficulty applying a ""function"" to each row. But maybe there is also another way to do it, not using density()?</p>

<p>What I essentially would like to do is to extract the fitted density values from density() to the returns in foo. If I just do plot(density(foo$Return)) it gives me the curve, however I would like to have the density values attached to the returns.</p>

<p>The size of the resulting matrix is C1344,3 = 403,716,544 rows and three columns - which is the transpose of the result of combn() function.</p>

<p>I thought of using the bigmemory package to create a file backed big.matrix so I can then assign the results of the combn() function. I can create a preallocated big matrix:</p>

<pre><code>library(bigmemory)

<p>I even tried coercing the result of <code>combn(x,3)</code> but I think that because the combn() function is returning an error, the big.matrix function doesn't work either.</p>

<pre><code>test &lt;- as.big.matrix(matrix(combn(x, 3)), backingfile = ""abc"")

There are two vectors that are taking a measure of quality (from 0-1) at points along a physical object. These measurements are indexed according to the distance the measurement was taken from the bottom of the object. Then, a quality improving transformation is applied to the object, and measurements are taken again. However, the number of measurements are not the same, nor are the points on which they are taken.</p>

<p>In R, the data looks something like this (but with many more points)</p>

<p>Before transformation:</p>

<pre><code>     value index
[1,]   0.3     6
[2,]   0.6    16
[3,]   0.1    25

[6,]   0.4    58
[7,]   0.4    64
[8,]   0.2    76
</code></pre>

<p>After transformation:</p>

<pre><code>      value index
 [1,]   0.3     1
 [2,]   0.5     9

 [9,]   0.3    76
[10,]   0.1    85
</code></pre>

<p>Under the assumption that quality along the object is continuous (if not observed at every point), and that the ammount of improvement during the tranformation is dependent on the point along the object, I would like to be able to show the distribution of quality improvement.</p>

<p>Since there are different numbers of measurements, and different indexes, I don't think</p>

<pre><code>plot(density(after$value - before$value))

<p>In my work, I frequently display scatterplots using text labels. That's meant a <code>plot()</code> command, followed by <code>text()</code>. I used <code>cex</code> to adjust to font size to what I wanted it very quickly.</p>

<p>I created a text scatterplot very quickly using <code>qplot</code>. But I can't adjust the size fast. Here's a silly code example:</p>

<pre><code>data(state)
qplot(Income,Population,data=as.data.frame(state.x77),geom=c(""smooth"",""text""),method=""lm"",label=state.abb)
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas in the old days I'd do:</p>

<pre><code>plot(xlim=range(Income),ylim=range(Population),data=state.x77,type=""n"")
text(Income,Population,state.abb,data=state.x77, cex=.5)
</code></pre>

<p>If I wanted the text size halved from what I saw at the defaults (oh, and I'd have to do a linear regression manually and add abline() to get the regression line -- nice to do it all in one via ggplot2).</p>

<p>I know I can add a size adjustment with size, but it's not a relative size adjustment like I'm used to. Hadley tweeted me to say that size is measured in mm, which isn't fully intuitive to me. Since I often adjust the size of the plot, either in R or in LaTeX, an absolute scale isn't as useful to me.</p>

<p>I must be missing something really simple. What is it?</p>

<p>Oh -- and I know I havn't really used the powerful ggplot2 commands yet -- just wanted to get the simple stuff down first.</p>

<p>The RSRuby documentation states that R should be installed with the option --enable-R-shlib. But the R documentation states that the Mac OS X installation does this by default.

<p>I'm chasing down why RSRuby can't find R home directory and this seems like the most likely problem. </p>

<p>This is my data frame (data), a time series of prices:</p>

<pre><code>Date          Price   Vol

1998-02-04     100      0.1
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to tell R, to </p>

<ul>
<li>take the 1st value of ""Vol"" and divide it by the 20th value of ""Price"", then</li>
<li>take the 2st value of ""Vol"" and divide it by the 21th value of ""Price"", then.</li>
<li>take the 3st value of ""Vol"" and divide it by the 22th value of ""Price"", then</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my other post, I was able to use this function to calculate a return over a holding period of 20 days:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; data.xts &lt;- xts(data[, -1], data[, 1])
&gt; hold &lt;- 20
&gt; f &lt;- function(x) log(tail(x, 1)) - log(head(x, 1))
&gt; data.xts$returns.xts &lt;- rollapply(data.xts$Price, FUN=f, 
  width=hold+1, align=""left"", na.pad=T)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to do something very similar for the problem stated above? So something like</p>

<pre><code>f1 &lt;- function(x,y) head(x, 1) / tail(y,1)
</code></pre>

<p>where x is ""Vol"" and y is ""Price"" and then apply ""rollapply""?</p>

<p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>UPDATE: @ Dr G:
Thanks for your suggestions. With a slight change, it did what I wanted!</p>

<pre><code>data.xts &lt;- xts(data[, -1], data[, 1])
hold &lt;- 20
data.xts$quo &lt;- lag(data.xts[,2], hold) / data.xts[,1]
</code></pre>

<p>Now my problem is, that the resulting data frame looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Date          Price   Vol     quo
1 1998-01-01     200      0.3     NA
2 1998-01-02     400      0.4     NA
3 1998-01-03     600     -0.2     NA
4 1998-01-04     100      0.1     NA
...
21 1998-01-20    180      0.2     0.003 
</code></pre>

<p>I know that there must be NA's as an outcome, but only for the last 20 observations, not the first 20 ones. The formula stated above calculates the correct values, however puts them starting at the 21st row instead of the first row. Do you know how I could change that? </p>

<p>I am stuck when fitting <code>spline(x,y)</code> and two of the x values are set to 1 due to rounding while y changes. I could hack around this but I would prefer to use a standard solution if available.</p>

<p>Here is an example data set</p>

<pre><code>d &lt;- data.frame(x = c(0.668732936336141, 0.95351462456867,

<pre><code>plot(d$x, d$y, ylim=c(0,50))
lines(spline(d$x, d$y),col='grey') #bad fit
lines(spline(d[-c(4:6),]$x, d[-c(4:6),]$y),col='red') #reasonable fit

<p>*Since posting this question, I realize that this will return <code>1</code> even though the data frame still contains the original value, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>&gt; dput(data.frame(x=0.99999999996))

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>After using dput to post this example data set, and some pointers from Dirk,  I can see that the problem is not in the truncation of the <code>x</code> values but the limits of the numerical errors in the model that I have used to calculate <code>y</code>. This justifies dropping a few of the equivalent data points (as in the example red line).</p>

<p>UPDATED with additional information
Thanks, Joshua, for your help so far.</p>

<p>Joshua asked for additional information in order to be able to help further.</p>

<p>The overall problem is to create a dataset of patients who attend different sessions of therapy.  Whether they attend or not depends on a number of parameters, including whether they attended the previous session (which is in <code>patients</code>), what ""class"" of patient they are (which is in <code>classlist</code>), how many sessions they have already either attended or skipped (<code>invited</code>) and how many sessions in a row they have missed (<code>missinrow</code>); all of those will vary.  If the previous session is less than full, additional patients get assigned to the new session (provided someone is waiting (<code>waitlist</code>). </p>

<p>When I do this one patient at a time, it works well.  But when I try to loop over all patients, I run into the </p>

<p>When I run this, i goes to 30 (which is right), insess[1] goes to 10 (also right), waitlist[1] goes to 0 (also right) but the patients matrix is only updated for i = 2.  I also checked that classlist has appropriate values.</p>

<p>I don't see where it is leaving the loop.  I think I'm using while incorrectly, but not sure how.</p>

                 itemb &lt;- ""fooflakes""
)

##' More info abuot variable!
##' @rdname simple
</code></pre>

<p>The comments that are inside the <code>list()</code> are just dropped by Roxygen I've confirmed this with:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; parse.file(""package-test/R/simple.R"")
$`1`
$`1`$description

<p>I have an options setting infrastructure, for which I'd like to use Roxygen to document the individual options.  It doesn't seem to matter whether or not I indent the comments, moving them flush-left doesn't seem to help. Adding @rdname to every block doesn't seem to help either.  Am I just expecting behavior that doesn't exist? In another question, the accepted answer said we could put Roxygen comments anywhere and that they would be collected.</p>

<p>So two fold: what am I missing above, and how do other people document individual data items if not like my attempt?</p>

<p>If I had cared only for the text or images, then I would use ?sink, or ?pdf.  But I don't know how to combine the two into one output in an easy way.</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't (yet) know LaTeX</li>
<li>Even knowing LaTeX, I want something with simple defaults to <strong>simply</strong> dump all the outputs together, and in order.  ""simply"" means - as little extra code/file management overhead as possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that something like sweave or brew are more scalable, but I am looking to see if there is a more ""simple"" solution for smaller projects/scripts.</p>

<p>I generated a file which contains a logical value either a ""TRUE"" or a ""FALSE"" on each line. Now I would like to read the logical data from the file into R. However the data that are read in are of mode ""character"" not logical values. I was wondering how to read the data as logical values from the file.</p>

<p>My R code is</p>

<pre><code>cat(FALSE,""\n"", file=""1.txt"", append=FALSE);
for (i in 2:5) cat(TRUE,""\n"",file=""1.txt"", append=TRUE);
a=scan(file=""1.txt"", what=""logical"")
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; mode(a)
1] ""character""
&gt; mode(a[1])
[1] ""character""
&gt; a[1]
[1] ""FALSE""
</code></pre>

<p>I want a[1] to be logical value.</p>
